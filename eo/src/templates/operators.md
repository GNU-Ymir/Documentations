# Operator overloading

Ymir proposes the possibility of overloading the operators. The
operator overload is done by rewriting the operations applied on
objects operands. No new syntax is used to define operator
overloading, as compilation time values (*cf*. []()) are used. 

There are multiple types of operators that can be overloaded, the
*unary operators*, *binary operators*, *comparison operators*, *access
operator*, *contain operator*, and the *for loop*. The presentation is
divided in two parts, the first one presents the operator that are
generally applicable to any type, and the second part presents the
operator overloading of set objects.
