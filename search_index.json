Ĉiuj deponejoj estas disponeblaj en\ngithub. En tiu dokumentado, kelkaj\nkonataj limoj de la lingvo estas kelkfoje emfazataj, kaj vokas\nkontribuojn.\n2.1. Instalo\nLa referenca kompililo de Ymir estas bazita sur la kompililo\nGCC, kiu oferas fortajn statikajn optimumigojn, kaj vastan aron da\ncelaj arĥitekturoj subtenataj.\nEstas du manieroj por instali la gyc (Gnu Ymir Compiler), denaske\naŭ per uzi Docker'a kontenero.\n2.1.1. Denaska instalo\nLa kompililo povas esti instalita sur linux debian operacia sistemo,\nper sekvi tiujn simplajn etapojn:\n\nUnue, vi bezonos elŝuti la du pakojn :\n\nlibmidgard-9-dev\nGYC\n\n\nKaj, instali ilin per uzi la ordonon dpkg: \n\n\n$ sudo dpkg -i libgmidgard_9.3.0_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i gyc-9_9.3.0_amd64.deb\n\n\nTiuj pakoj dependas de :\n\ng++-9\ngcc-9-base\nlibc6 >= 2.21\nlibgmp10 >= 2:5.0.1~\nlibmpc3\nlibmpfr6 >= 3.1.3\nzlib1g >= 1:1.1.4\nlibgcc1\nzlib1g-dev\nzlib1g >= 1:1.2.0\nlibgc-dev >= 1:7.4.2\n\nSe unu aŭ pli el tiuj estas malinstalita, vi akiros eraron. Tiu povas esti\nsolvita per lanĉi la sekvan ordonon:\nsudo apt --fix-broken install\n\n\nKaj poste reinstali la pakon kiu antaŭe malsukcesis (uzante dpkg). La\nkompililo esta nun instalita sub la nomo gyc.\n$ gyc --version\n\ngyc-9 (GCC) 9.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n\n2.1.2. Malinstali la denaskan version\nKiel por iu ajn debian' pako, la malinstalo estas farita tiel : \n$ dpkg -r gyc-9\n$ dpkg -r libgmidgard-9-dev\n\n\nAverto. La malinstalo povas forigi vian instalon de gcc (eĉ se\nmi neniam fakte observis tion). Sed vi povas simple reinstali ĝin, se\nestas problemo, per skribi:\nsudo apt install --reinstall gcc-9\n\n2.2. Docker' instalo\nPor komenci, vi bezonos Docker'n.\n$ sudo apt install docker.io\n\n\nTiam, elŝuti la docker'n bildon el la oficiala deponejo : \n$ docker pull gnuymir/9.3.0-amd64\n\n\nLa kompililo esta nun atingebla tra la kontenero: \n$ docker run -t -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp gnuymir/9.3.0-amd64 --version \ngyc-9 (GCC) 9.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n\nPor farigi la uzon de la kontenero pli facila, vi povas aldoni\nalnomon en la dosierujo ~/.local/bin. Unue malfermu la dosieron\n~/.local/bin/gyc kaj algluu la sekvan linion:\ndocker run -t -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp gnuymir/9.3.0-amd64 $*\n\n\nCertigu ke via PATH variablo enhavas la dosierujon\n~/.local/bin. Malfermu novan ŝelon kaj lanĉu la sekvajn ordonojn:\n$ chmod +x ~/.local/bin/gyc\n$ gyc --version\n\ngyc (GCC) 9.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

Alie, kiam la tipo estas donita, ĝi\nestas kontrolita kaj devas kongrui kun la tipo de la unua valoro.\n1.1. Tipo de variablo\nLa tipo de la variablo, kiel prezentata je la enkonduko, estas\nindikata je la deklaro de la variablo. Tio implicas statikan tipon por\nĉiuj variabloj, kies rezulto estas ke oni ne povas ŝanĝi la tipon de\nvariablo dum ĝia vivdaŭro. Por ilustri tiun ideon, la sekva fontkodo\ndeklaras variablon, kies tipo estas i32, kaj provas meti valoron\nkies tipo estas f32 en ĝi. La programlingvo ne akceptas tion, do\nla kompililo ĵetas eraron.\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = 12; // 12 estas litero de tipo i32 (entjera valoro sur 32 bitoj)\n    //  ^^^ tiu dekoracio, prezentata en la sekva sekcio, ne gravas por la momento\n\n    x = 89.0f; // 89.0f estas litero kies tipo estas f32 (valoro kun flosanta punkto)\n}\n\n La kompililo, pro ke la fontkodo estas neakceptebla Ymir\nprogramo, ĵetas eraron. La eraro, prezentata je la sekva bloko da\nkodo, informas ke la variablo x de tipo i32, estas\nmalkongrua kun la valoro de tipo f32.\nError : incompatible types mut i32 and f32\n --> main.yr:(5,4)\n 5  ┃     x = 89.0f; // 89.0f estas litero kies tipo estas f32 (valoro kun flosanta punkto)\n    ╋       ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n1.2. Ŝanĝebleco de variablo\nDekoracioj estas uzataj por difini kiel trakti variablojn. La\nĉefvortoj ref kaj dmut estos priskribitaj en alia ĉapitro\n(kp. Ligoj kaj\nReferencoj). Por\nla momento, ni nur parolos pri la vorto mut. Tiu ĉefvorto estas\nuzata por difini ke la valoro de variablo estas ŝanĝebla. Variablo,\nkiu estas deklarita sen tiu vorto mut, estas apriore\nmalŝanĝebla, farante ke ĝia valoro estas definitiva.\nAlivorte, se variablo estas deklarita kiel malŝanĝebla, tiam ĝi estas\nligita al valoro, kiun la variablo ne povas ŝanĝi dum sia tuta\nvivdaŭro. La ideo malantaŭ la apriora malŝanĝebleco estas malhelpi\nnedeziratajn erarojn, per devigi la uzantojn, ke ili difinu kiujn\nvariablojn estas ŝanĝeblaj, kun la uzo de intece pli multvorta\nsintakso, dum ĉiuj la aliaj variabloj estas malŝanĝeblaj.\nEn la sekva fontkodo variablo x, kies tipo estas i32,\nestas deklarita. Tiu variablo estas malŝanĝebla, (ĉar la dekoracio\nmut ne estas uzata). Poste la linio 7, kiu konsistas el\nprovi ŝanĝi la valoron de la variablo x, estas malakceptita per\nla programlingvo, do ankaŭ per la kompililo, kiu ĵetas eraron.\n\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 2;    \n    println (\"X valoras : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X valoras : \", x);\n}\n\n\nDe la supra fontkodo, la kompililo ĵetas la sekvan eraron. Tiu eraro\ninformas ke la atribuo ne estas permesata, pro la naturo de la\nvariablo x, kiu estas malŝanĝebla. En Ymir, variabla\nŝanĝebleco, kaj tipa ŝanĝebleco certigas, per statikaj kontroloj, ke\nkiam variablo estas deklarita kiel ne havanta skriban permeson al\nvaloro, do estas neniu maniero por gajni skriban permeson al tiu\nvaloro trans tiu variablo. Kvankam, tio povas esti kelkfoje frustra\npor la uzanto.\nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(7,2)\n    ┃ \n 7  ┃     x = 3; \n    ┃     ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nOni povas ŝanĝi la antaŭan ekzemplon por farigi la variablon x\nŝanĝebla. Tiu ŝanĝo implicas la uzon de la ĉefvorto mut, kiu —\nmetita antaŭ la nomo de la variablo, je la deklaro — farigas ĝin\nŝanĝebla. Danke al tiu ŝanĝo, la sekva fontkodo estas nun akceptebla\nprogramo, do estas akceptita de la kompililo.\n\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = 2;    \n    println (\"X valoras : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X valoras : \", x);\n}\n\n\nRezultoj:\nX valoras : 2\nX valoras : 3\n Fakte, ŝanĝebleco ne rilatas al variabloj, sed al tipoj. La\nYmir programlingvo proponas kompleksan sistemon de tipa ŝanĝebleco,\nkies kompreno bezonas ke oni komprenas bone la datumajn tipojn\nantaŭe. En la sekvaj sekcioj kaj ĉapitroj, pro tiu kialo, ni prezentos\nla tipan sistemon (kaj la diversajn bazajn tipojn de datumo, kiujn oni\npovas krei en Ymir - kp. Datumaj\ntipoj),\nantaŭ ol ni revenos al ŝanĝebleco, kaj ol ni havos tutan vidon de la\nŝanĝebleca sistemo en la ĉapitro Ligoj kaj\nReferencoj.\n1.3. Unua valoro\nVariablo ĉiam estas deklarita kun valoro. La celo estas ke oni\npovu certigi ke ĉiuj datumoj venas de ie, kaj ne venas de hazarda\nstato de memoro de la maŝino kiu plenumas la programon (kiel eblas en\nC programlingvo).\nOni povas argumenti ke statikaj kontroloj povas esti uzitaj por\ncertigi ke variablo estu valorigita antaŭ ol ĝi estas uzita, kaj\nargumenti ke trudi unuan valoron, ne estas la plej bona maniero por\nplenumi datuman validecon. Se temas pli pri opinio ol scienca rezono,\nni pensas ke disigi la inicializon de variablo farigas programon pli\nmalfacila por legi. Plie, malŝanĝeblaj variabloj estus ŝanĝeblaj dum\nunu asigno, farante la konduton de la programo ankoraŭ pli malfacila\npor kompreni.\nLa sekva tabulo montras du ekzemplojn de fontkodo, kies\nkondutoj estas similaj. Je la maldekstra parto, valida fontkodo\nakceptebla de la Ymir programlingvo, kaj je la dekstra parto,\nfontkodo malakceptebla pro la argumentoj, kiujn ni prezentis.\n\n\n A \n B \n\n\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let i = if (true) {\n        42\n    } else {\n        7\n    };\n}\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let i : i32;\n    if (true) {\n        i = 42;\n    } else {\n        i = 7;\n    };\n}\n\n\n\nOni povas noti de la maldekstra programo, ke la if esprimo havas\nvaloron. Valoro komputita kiel la rezulto de la esprimo (je tiu okazo\nla valoro 42 de tipo i32). Fakte, ĉiuj esprimoj povas havi\nvaloron en Ymir, forigante la limon, kiun ni enkondukis per la\ntrudo de unua valoro.\n1.4. Mallokaj variabloj\nKvankam mallokaj variabloj havas relative malbonan reputacion pro\nmulte da bonaj kialoj, ni decidis lasi la eblon difini ilin, pro tio\nke malgraŭ ĉio, ili permesas paradigmojn de programado, kiuj estus\nmaleblaj alie.\nMallokaj variabloj estas difinitaj kiel lokaj variabloj, krom ke oni\nanstataŭigas la ĉefvorton let per la vorto static. La\nsekva fontkodo prezentas uzon de malŝanĝebla malloka variablo. Tio\nestas nur ekzemplo, ĉar uzo de enumeracio (kp.\nEnumeracio)\nestus probable pli bona por tiu speciala afero.\nimport std::io\n\nstatic pi = 3.14159265359\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"La valoro de Pi estas : \", pi);\n}\n\n\nĈiuj informoj pri lokaj variabloj estas validaj por mallokaj\nvariabloj. Temas pri statika tipigado, ŝanĝebleco, kaj unuaj valoroj. Ne\nestas limoj pri la valoroj, kiuj povas esti uzitaj kiel unuaj valoroj\nde mallokaj variabloj, nek estas limoj pri la formo de la inicializo. Voko\nde funkcioj, kondiĉaj esprimoj, kreo de objektoj, ktp. nenio estis\nforgesita.\nMallokaj variabloj estas inicializitaj antaŭ la komenco de la programo mem,\ntio volas diri antaŭ ol la funkcio main estos vokita. Por\nilustri tiun punkton, la sekva fontkodo kreas mallokan variablon kies\ntipo estas i32, kaj kiu estas inicializita per voko de la funkcio\nfoo. Tiu funkcio foo per voki la funkcion println\nskribas mesaĝon sur la ŝelo (komputila terminalo), poste la funkcio\nmain faras same.\nimport std::io;\n\nstatic __GLOBAL__ = foo ();\n\n/**\n  * Tiu funkcio skribas la mesaĝon \"foo\", kaj returnas la valoron 42\n  */\ndef foo ()-> i32 {\n  println (\"foo\");\n  42\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"__GLOBAL__ = \", __GLOBAL__);\n}\n\n\nRezultoj:\nfoo\n__GLOBAL__ = 42\n1.4.1. Ordo de inicializoj\nEstas neniu garantio pri la ordo de la inicializoj de mallokaj\nvariabloj. Tiu estas verŝajne la unua granda limo, kiun oni povas noti\npri la programlingvo Ymir. Kontribuo, permesi tian garantion\nestus tute bonvena kontribuo, sed tio estas malverŝajne ebla kiam la\nmallokaj variabloj estas difinitaj en malsamaj pakaĵoj (kp.\nPakaĵoj).\nPor la momento, ĉar ne eblas certigi bonan ordon de inicializoj de mallokaj\nvariabloj, antaŭ ol la programo komencos, ne estas permesita inicializi\nmallokan variablon per la valoro de alia malloka variablo. Tamen, tiu\nkontrolo estas tre lima, ĉar la valoro de malloka variablo povas esti\nkreita per voko de funkcio, kaj tiu funkcio povas uzi la valoron de\nalia malloka variablo. La sekva fontkodo ilustras tiun konduton.\nstatic __A__ = 42;\nstatic __B__ = __A__; \nstatic __C__ = foo ();\n\ndef foo () -> i32 {\n    __A__\n}\n\n\nLa kompililo bedaŭrinde nur kapablas vidi la dependan inicializon de\n__B__, kaj lasos la inicializon de __C__ funkcii. Eĉ se je tiu\nspeciala okazo la dependeco estas tre klare videbla, tio povas esti\npli malfacila se la funkcio foo estus difinita en malsama\npakaĵo, kaj se oni nur havus ĝian prototipon.\nError : the global var main::__B__ cannot be initialized from the value of main::__A__\n --> main.yr:(2,8)\n 2  ┃ static __B__ = __A__; \n    ╋        ^^^^^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(1,8)\n    ┃  1  ┃ static __A__ = 42;\n    ┃     ╋        ^^^^^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(2,16)\n    ┃  2  ┃ static __B__ = __A__; \n    ┃     ╋                ^^^^^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n1.5. Ombreco kaj regiono\n1.5.1. Vivdaŭro\nLa vivdaŭro de variablo estas difinita per ĝia regiono. Kunmetanta\nesprimojn apartigitaj per punktokomoj, inter kunigaj krampoj, regiono\nestas semantika elemento, kiu estas bone konita en programlingvoj. Ĝi\nhavas kelkajn specialaĵojn en Ymir, sed tiuj estos prezentitaj en\nvenontaj ĉapitroj (kp.\nFunkcioj,\nGardanto de\nregiono),\nkaj ne interesas nin por la momento.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    {\n        let x = 12;\n    } // x ne plu ekzistas post la fino de tiu regiono\n    println (x);\n}\n\n\nSe variablo estas deklarita en regiono, kaj neniam estas uzita dum\nĝia vivdaŭro, la kompililo ĵetas eraron. Por eviti tian eraron, la\nvariablo povas nomiĝi _. Se ŝajnas senutila deklari variablon\nkiun oni ne uzas, povas esti utila kelkfoje (ekzemple kiam oni\ndeklaras parametroj de homonima funkcio, kp. Klasa\nheredeco).\nVariablo, kiu nomiĝas _, estas anonima, tiam ne estas maniero\npor retrovi ĝian valoron.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let _ = 12; // deklaras anoniman valoron\n}\n\n1.5.2. Ombreco\nDu variabloj, kun la sama nomo, ne povas ekzisti en koliziantaj\nregionoj, t.e. se variablo havas la saman nomon ol vivanta variablo\nje la aktuala regiono, la fontkodo ne estas akceptebla programo, kaj\nla kompilo ĵetas eraron pro ombreco. La sekva fontkodo ilustras tiun\npunkton, kie du variabloj estas deklaritaj en la sama regiono kun la\nsama nomo x.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 1;    \n    let x = 2;    \n    { \n        let x = 3; \n    }\n}\n\n La kompililo ĵetas la sekvan eraron. Eĉ la deklaro de la lasta\nvariablo en la regiono malfermita je la linio 4 estas\nmalpermesita. Multe da eraroj povas esti evitataj per simple forlasi\ntiun eblon. Eblo kiu, laŭ nia opinio, ne alportas iun ajn avantaĝo.\nError : declaration of x shadows another declaration\n --> main.yr:(3,9)\n 3  ┃     let x = 2;    \n    ╋         ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(2,9)\n    ┃  2  ┃     let x = 1;    \n    ┃     ╋         ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\nError : declaration of x shadows another declaration\n --> main.yr:(5,13)\n 5  ┃         let x = 3; \n    ╋             ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(2,9)\n    ┃  2  ┃     let x = 1;    \n    ┃     ╋         ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nMallokaj variabloj ne kreas ombron sur lokaj variabloj.

Skalaraj tipoj\nSkalaraj tipoj priskribas ĉiujn tipojn, kiuj enhavas nur unu\nvaloron. Ymir havas kvin bazajn skalarajn tipojn: entjeroj,\nglitkomoj, skribsigno, buleo, kaj montriloj. Tiuj tipoj havas\nmalsamajn grandecojn, kaj estas uzataj por malsamaj celoj.\n1.2.1. Entjeraj tipoj\nEntjero estas numbro, kiu ne havas flusanta punkto. Estas pluraj\nentjeraj tipoj en Ymir, tiuj kiuj estas signaj kaj tiuj kiuj estas\nmalsignaj. Signaj kaj malsignaj temas pri la eblo de tiu tipo\nreprezenti negativajn valorojn. La signaj entjeraj tipoj komencas kun\nla litero i, kiam malsignaj entjeraj tipoj komencas kun la\nlitero u. La jena tabelo listas ĉiujn la entjerajn tipojn, kaj\nordigas ilin laŭ ilia grandeco en memoro.\n\n\n\nGrandeco\nSigna\nMalsigna\n\n\n\n\n8 bitoj\ni8\nu8\n\n\n16 bitoj\ni16\nu16\n\n\n32 bitoj\ni32\nu32\n\n\n64 bitoj\ni64\nu64\n\n\narch\nisize\nusize\n\n\n\nLa usize kaj isize tipoj dependas de la arĥitekturo de la\nmaŝino kiu rulas la programon, kaj havas la saman grandecon ol\nmontrilojn.\nĈiuj signaj entjeraj tipoj povas stoki valorojn etendiĝante de\n-(2n - 1) ĝis 2 n - 1, kie n estas la\ngrandeco de la entjero en memoro. Malsignaj tipoj aliflanke, povas\nstoki numbrojn kies amplekso etendiĝas de 0 ĝis 2n -\n1. Ekzemple, la tipo i8 povas stoki valorojn etendiĝante de\n-128 ĝis 127, kaj la tipo u8 povas stoki valorojn\netendiĝante de 0 ĝis 255.\nOni povas skribi entjerajn literojn laŭ du formoj, decimale 9_234 aŭ\ndeksesume 0x897A. La signo _ estas simple ignorita.\nKiel antaŭe indikita, ĉiuj tipoj havas atribuojn. La sekva tabelo\nlistas la atribuojn specifaj de la entjeraj tipoj.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nmax\nLa plej granda valoro\n\n\nmin\nLa malplej granda valoro\n\n\n\nKontrolo de Superfluo estas plenumita sur literoj dum la kompilado,\nkaj eraro estas ĵetita de la kompililo se la entjera tipo uzita ne\npovas kodi la valoron, pro ke ĝi estas tro larĝa. Ekzemple:\ndef main () {\n    let x : i8 = 934i8;\n}\n\nĈar i8 povas nur stoki valoron, kiu iras de -127 ĝis\n128, la valoro 934 ne taŭgus.

Ekzemple, se oni provas aldoni 1 al variablo de tipo\ni16, kiu enhavas la valoron 32767, la rezulto estos\n-32768. Kontribuo: Krei dinamikan manieron por kontrolo\nsuperfluo de aritmetika operacio (almenaŭ je sencimigado).\n1.2.2. Tipoj kun flusanta punkto\nTipoj kun flusanta punkto temas pri numbroj kiun oni ne povas kodi\nper entjero, pro ke ili havas decimalan parton. Ymir proponas du\ntipojn kun flusanta punkto, f32 kaj f64, kiuj havas\ngrandecon de respektive 32 kaj 64 bitoj.\nLa prefikso f povas esti aldonita al la fino de litero, por\nspecifi ke ĝi temas pri f32 anstataŭe f64, kiel estas\napriore.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 1.0; \n    let y : f32 = 1.0f;\n}\n\nLa jena tabelo listas la atribuojn specifaj de la tipoj kun flusanta\npunkto.\n\n\n\nNomo\nSignifo\n\n\n\n\ninit\nLa unua valoro - nan\n\n\nmax\nLa plej granda finia valoro, kiun la tipo povas kodi\n\n\nmin\nLa malplej granda finia valoro, kun la tipo povas kodi\n\n\nnan\nLa valoro Not a Number (ne iu nombro)\n\n\ndig\nLa nombro de decimaloj de precizeco\n\n\ninf\nLa pozitiva valoro de nefinio\n\n\nepsilon\nLa malplej granda pliigo al la valoro 1\n\n\nmant_dig\nNombro da bitoj en la mantiso\n\n\nmax_10_exp\nLa plej granda entjera valoro, tiel ke 10max_10_exp10^{max\\_10\\_exp}10​max_10_exp​​ estas kodebla\n\n\nmax_exp\nLa plej granda entjera valoro, tiel ke 2max_exp−12^{max\\_exp-1}2​max_exp−1​​ estas kodebla\n\n\nmin_10_exp\nLa malplej granda entjera valoro tiel ke 10min_10_exp10^{min\\_10\\_exp}10​min_10_exp​​ estas kodebla kiel norma valoro\n\n\nmin_exp\nLa malplej granda entjera valoro, tiel ke 2min_exp−12^{min\\_exp-1}2​min_exp−1​​ estas kodebla kiel norma valoro\n\n\n\n1.2.3. Bulea tipo\nBuleo estas tre simpla tipo, kiun havas nur du eblajn valorojn, aŭ\ntrue (vera) aŭ false (malvera). Ekzemple : \ndef main () {\n    let b = true;\n    let f : bool = false;\n}\n\n\nLa jena tabelo listas la atribuojn specifaj de la bulea tipo.\n\n\n\nNomo\nSignifo\n\n\n\n\ninit\nLa unua valoro - false\n\n\n\n1.2.4. Skribsignaj tipoj\nLa c8 kaj c32 estas la tipoj uzitaj por kodi la\nsignojn. La c32 skribsignoj havas grandecon de kvar bitokoj, kaj\npovas stoki iun ajn unikodan valoron. Skribsignaj literoj povas esti\nskribitaj laŭ du formoj, kaj estas ĉiam ĉirkaŭigitaj per la signo\n'. La unua formo estas la signo ĝi mem ekzemple r, kaj la\ndua estas la unikoda valoro de la signo, skribita kiel entjera litero,\nkiel sekvas \\u{12}, aŭ \\u{0xB}.\nKiel kun entjeraj literoj, estas necesa ke oni aldonu prefikson je la\nfino de la litero por sciigi la kompililon pri kiu tipo temas la\nlitero. La prefiksoj uzitaj por la skribsignaj tipoj estas c8,\nse nenio estas precizigita, tiel la tipo estas c32.\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺';    \n    let y = '\\u{0x263A}';\n}\n\n\nSe la signo en la litero estas tro larĝa por esti stokita en la\nskribsigna tipo, eraron ĵetas la kompililo. Ekzemple:\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺'c8; \n}\n\n\nLa sekva eraro, kiun estas ĵetita per la kompililo kompilante la\nantaŭan ekzemplon, volas diri ke almenaŭ 3 bitokoj estas necesaj por\nstoki la valoron, do ĝi ne taŭgas en nur unu bitoko (grando de\nc8).\nError : malformed literal, number of c8 is 3\n --> main.yr:(2,10)\n    | \n 2  |     let x = '☺'c8; \n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nLa jena tabelo listas la atribuojn specifaj de la skribsignaj tipoj.\n\n\n\nNomo\nSignifo\n\n\n\n\ninit\nLa unua valoro - \\u{0}\n\n\n\n1.2.5. Montrilojn\nMontriloj estas valoroj, kiuj stokas memorajn adresojn. Ili povas esti\nuzitaj por stoki la lokon de datumo. En Ymir, oni konsideras ke\nmontrilo estas tre malalta programa konstruo, kaj estas ĉefe uzata en\nla norma biblioteko, por interfaci kun semantiko de maŝina alteco. Oni\nkomplete povas srkibi programon sen bezoni montrilojn, kaj ni\nrekomandas ke vi ne uzu ilin.\nMontriloj estas difinitaj per la signo & sur tipo, aŭ sur\nvaloro. Ili estas ligeblaj valoroj (kp. Ligoj kaj\nReferencoj).\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &SegFault, &AssertError\n{\n    let mut i = 12;\n    let p : &i32 = &i; // kreo de montrilo stokanta la adreson de i\n    i = 42;\n    assert (*p == 42); // malreferenco de la montrilon, por atingi la valoron estanta al la adreso\n}\n\n\nMontriloj estas malsekuraj, kaj malreferenci montrilon povas krei\nnedifineblan konduton, dependante de kie ĝi montras. Tio povas kelkfoje\nĵeti eraron de segmentado (segmentation fault) je la rulado de la\nprogramo. Tiaj eraroj povas esti traktitaj, kiel estas prezentata en\nla ĉapitro Traktado de\neraroj.\nAverto Gardu enmense ke la eraro de segmentado povas ne okazi\nkvankam la montrilo iras al disa adreso. La plej bona maniero por\neviti nedifineblan konduton estas ke oni ne uzu montrilojn kaj\nanstataŭe uzu normajn funkciojn, aŭ semantike certigitajn konstruojn\n(kp. Ligoj kaj\nReferencoj).\n\nLa jena tabelo listas la atribuojn specifaj de la montrila tipo.\n\n\n\nNomo\nSignifo\n\n\n\n\ninner\nLa interna tipo - ekzemple : i32 por &i32\n\n\n\n1.3. Kombinaj tipoj\nMalkiel skalaraj tipoj, kombinaj tipoj povas enhavi plurajn\nvalorojn. Estas tri kombinaj tipoj en Ymir: opoj, amplekso, kaj\ntabeloj.\n1.3.1. Opo\nOpo estas finia vico de valoroj de malsimilaj tipoj. Opoj havas\nfiksitan valenton. La valento de opo estas difinitaj je la kompila\nmomento, kaj priskribas la nombron de valoro, kiuj estas enhavitaj de\nla opo. Ĉiuj elementoj de opo havas topon, kaj ordo. Opa litero estas\nskribita uzante rondaj krampoj, kun komoj apartigante la valorojn. Opo\nde unu valoro povas esti difinita, per meti komon post la unua valoro,\ntuje sekvita de fermanta ronda krampo. Tiel la kompilo povas kompreni\nke temas pri opo, kaj ne nur pri prioritata esprimo.\ndef main () {\n    let t : (i32, c32, f64) = (1, 'r', 3.14);  // opo kun tri valoroj\n    let t2 : (i32,) = (1,); // opo de unu valoro\n    let t3 : i32 = (1); // simpla i32'a valoro\n}\n\n\nEn la antaŭa ekzemplo, la opo t estas sola elemento, kaj povas\nesti uzita kiel funkcia parametro aŭ kiel returna valoro de\nfunkcio. Oni povas ĝin apartigi, por repreni la valorojn, kiuj\nkomponas ĝin. Estas tri manieroj por disigi opon.\n1) La punkto operatoro ., sekvita de entjera valoro, kiu estas\nkonita je la kompila momento. Tiu valoro povas esti komputita per\nkompleksa esprimo tiel longe, kiel oni povas komputi ĝin je la kompila\nmomento (kp. Rulado je kompila\nmomento).\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let z : i32 = t._0;\n    let y : c32 = t. (0 + 1); \n    println (t.2);\n}\n\n\n2) La sintakso de opa disigo. Tiu sintakso estas proksima al ties de\nvariabla deklaro, pro ke ĝi kreas novajn variablojn kiuj enhavos\nparton de la opo, kiu estas disigota. En la sekva ekzemplo, oni povas\nnoti ke la sintakso de opa disigo povas esti uzita por disigi nur\nkelkajn el la valoroj de la opo. La tipo de la variablo e estas\nopo, kies ekzakta tipo estas (c32, f64), kaj ĝiaj valoroj estas\n('r', 3.14) kiam la variablo f enhavas la valoron 1\nde tipo i32.\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let (x, y, z) = t;\n\n    let (f, e...) = t;\n    println (f, \" \", e.0);\n}\n\n\n3) La ĉefvorto expand (etendi). Tiu ĉefvorto kreas reskribon je\nla momento de la kompilado, kiu etendas la valorojn de la opo en\nliston de valoroj. Tiu listo estas tiam uzita por krei aliajn opojn,\nvoki funkcion, ktp. La jena ekzemplo montras du uzon de la ĉefvorto\nexpand, unue por voki funkcion, kiu akceptas du parametrojn, kaj\ndur por krei alian opon enhavanta tri valorojn.\nimport std::io\n\ndef add (a : i32, b : i32) -> i32 \n    a + b\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (1, 2);\n    println (add (expand x)); \n    // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    // Estos reskribita kiel \n    // println (add (x.0, x.1));\n\n    let j : (i32, i32, i32) = (1, expand x);    \n    // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    // reskribita en : (1, x.0, x.1)\n}\n\n\nEstas du aliaj manieroj por disigi opojn. Tiuj manieroj estas\nprezentataj en alia ĉapitro. La jena tabelo listas la atribuojn\nspecifaj de opa tipo.\n\n\n\nNomo\nSignifo\n\n\n\n\narity\nLa nombro da elemento, kiun la opo enhavas (en u32 valoro)\n\n\ninit\nOpa valoro, kie ĉiuj elementoj estas valorizitaj per init\n\n\n\n1.3.2. Amplekso\nAmplekso estas tipo kiu enhavas valorojn difinantaj\nintervalon. Ampleksa tipo estas nomita r!T kie T estas la\ntipo de la valoroj kodantaj la limoj de la intervalo. Ampleksa litero\nestas kreitaj per la signoj .. aŭ .... Estas kvar valoroj\nen amplekso, kiu estas stokitaj en kampoj, montrataj en la jena\ntabelo. Tiuj kampoj estas atingeblaj per la punkto operatoro ..\n\n\n\nNomo\nTipo\nValoro\n\n\n\n\nfst\nT\nLa unua limo\n\n\nscd\nT\nLa dua limo\n\n\nstep\nmut T\nLa paŝo de la intervalo\n\n\ncontain\nbool\nVera se kaj nur se la dua limo estas inkluzivita de la intervalo\n\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let range : r!(i32) = 1 .. 8;     \n    let c_range : r!(i32) = 1 ... 8;\n}\n\n\nLa funkcio step_by (per_paŝo), prenas amplekson kiel parametro,\nkaj returnas alian amplekson kun alia paŝo. Tiu funkcio estas kerna\nfunkcio, do estas nenio por importi.\ndef main () { \n    let range = (1 .. 8).step_by (2); \n}\n\n\nLa ĉapitro Gvidaj\nfluoj\nprezentas ekzemplojn kie la tipo amplekso estas uzinda.\n1.3.3. Tabelo\nTabelo estas kolekto da valoroj de la sama tipo, en koneksa\nmemoro. Malkiel opoj, la grandeco de tabelo estas nekonata je la\nkompila momento, kaj en Ymir, tabeloj estas similaj al tranĉoj, do\nni nomos ilin tiel ekde nun. Tranĉaj literoj estas difinitaj kun\nsintakso proksima al ties de opo, sed kun rektaj krampoj antastaŭ\nrondaj, ekzemple [1, 2, 3]. La tipo de tranĉô estas ankaŭ\ndifinita kun rektaj krampoj, ekzemple [i32], kiu volas diri ke\ntemas pri tranĉo enhavanta i32'ajn valorojn.\nLitero de Signoĉeno, ĉirkaŭigita de duopaj citiloj \" estas\nspecialaĵo de litero de tranĉo. Ne estas signoĉena tipo en Ymir, sed\nnur tranĉaj tipoj. Pro tio, la tipo de signoĉeno estas [c32], aŭ\n[c8], dependante de la tipo, kiun enhavas la tranĉo. Signoĉena\nlitero povas esti prefiksigita per la ĉefvorto s8 aŭ s32\npor determini la kodan sistemon, kiu estas uzata (utf-8 aŭ\nutf-32). Apriore, kiam ne estas prefikso la signoĉena litero estas de\ntipo [c32].\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () { \n    let x = [1, 2, 3]; //  [i32] tranĉo\n    let y = \"Hello World !!\"; // [c32] tranĉo\n    let z = \"Hello World !!\"s8; // [c8] tranĉo\n}\n\n\nAverto: la longo de [c8] literoj povas ŝajni malvera pro la\nkoda sistemo. Ekzemple, la tranĉo \"☺\"s8 havas longon de\n3. Por resumi, [c8] tranĉoj estas kodata per la utf-8\nsistemo, kiam [c32] per la koda sistemo.\nTranĉo estas duvortaj objekto, la unua vorto estas la longo de la\ntranĉo, kaj la dua estas montrilo al la datumo stokita en la\ntranĉo. Tranĉo estas ligebla tipo, kiu volas diri ke ĝia ŝanĝebleco\nestas pli komplika ol la ŝanĝebleco de skalara tipo (krom montrilo),\nĉar ĝi pruntas memoron, kiu ne estas aŭtomate kopiita kiam atribuo al\nalia variablo estas farita. Tio estas priskribita en la ĉapitro Ligoj\nkaj\nReferencoj.\nLa kampo len permesas atingi la longon de la tranĉo uzante la\npunkta operatoro .. La longo de tranĉo estas stokita kiel\nusize'a valoro.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n   let x = [1, 2, 3];\n   println (\"The value of x : \", x); \n   println (\"The length of x : \", x.len);\n}\n\n\nSimile, la ptr kampo, donas atingeblecon al la montrilo de la\ntranĉo. La tipo de tiu montrilo dependas de la tipo de la tranĉo mem,\nkaj estas neniam ŝanĝebla. Montrilo estas tute malgrava por preskaŭ\nĉiuj Ymir'aj programoj, kaj ni suspektas ke vi neniam bezonos\nilin. Ili estas difinitaj por fari malaltajn programadajn operaciojn,\nkaj estas ĉefe uzitaj en la norma biblioteko.\nPor atingi elementojn de la tabelo, la rektaj krampaj operatoro\n[] estas uzata. Ĝi prenas aŭ entjera valoro aŭ amplekso kiel\nparametro. Kiam amplekso estas donita, alia tranĉo, kiu pruntas parton\nde la unua tranĉo estas kreita. La paŝo de la amplekso ne havas\nefikon. Kontribuo eble oni povu aldoni tion. Alie, kiam entjera\nvaloro estas uzata, kiun ni nomos i, la valoro je la i'a\nindekso estas returnita.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray \n{\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let y = x [0 .. 2];\n    let z = x [0];\n\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z); \n}\n\n\nLa longo de tranĉo estas nekonata je la momento de la kompilado, kaj\natingi la valorojn de la tranĉo povas esti farita kun dinamikaj\nentjeroj, kies valoroj estas ankaŭ nekonataj je la kompila\nmomento. Pro tiu kialo, eblas ke la parametro uzita en la operatoro\niras post la longo de la tranĉo. Kun tio enmense, tranĉo estas\nkonsiderita malsekura, kaj povas ĵeti escepton de tipo\n&OutOfArray. La escpeta sistemo, kaj traktado de eraroj estas\npriskribita en la ĉapitro Traktado de\neraroj.\nTranĉoj povas esti kroĉitaj, por formi alian tranĉon. La kroĉo estas\nfarita per la tilda operatoro ~ sur du tranĉoj. Por konvene\nfunkcii kaj esti akceptebla de la programlingvo, la du tranĉoj devas\nesti de la sama tipo (sed ne nepre kun la sama ŝanĝebleco, la\nŝanĝebleco la plej limiga estas uzata, kp. Ligoj kaj\nReferencoj).\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> [i32] {\n    [8, 7, 6]\n}\n\ndef main ()  {\n    println ([1, 2, 3] ~ foo ());\n}\n\n\nRezultoj: \n[1, 2, 3, 8, 7, 6]\n\nLa tildan operatoron ni elektis, por eviti ambiguecon. En kelkaj\nprogramlingvoj, kiel Java, la kroĉo estas farita uzante la adician\noperatoron +, kio kelkfoje kreas kelkajn ambiguaĵojn kiam ĝi\nkroĉas signoĉenojn kun aliaj elementoj kiel entjeroj. Ekzemple, la\nesprimo \"foo\" + 1 + 2 estas ambigua. Oni povas noti malgraŭe ke\nĉar kroĉo nur funkcias se oni uzas du tranĉojn de la sama tipo, la\nesprimo \"foo\" ~ 2 estas malakceptebla. Efektive \"foo\"\nestas de tipo [c32] kaj 2 de tipo i32.\nAlia sintakso povas esti uzata por krei tranĉojn. Tiu sintakso nomita\nasigno de tranĉo asignas memoron en la amaso, kaj atribuas la\nsaman valoron al ĉiuj indeksoj de la tranĉo.\nimport std::io\nimport std::random;\n\ndef main () {\n    let a : [i32] = [0 ; new 100u64]; // tiu evitas ke oni skribu 100 nulojn\n                                      // sed la rezulto estas simila\n\n    let b = [12 ; new uniform (10, 100)]; \n    //                ^^^^^^^ kreas numbron hazarde inter la valoro 10 kaj 100\n    println (a, \" \", b);\n}\n\n\nLa jena tabelo listas la atribuojn speciafaj de la tranĉa tipo.\n\n\n\nNomo\nSignifo\n\n\n\n\ninner\nLa interna tipo\n\n\ninit\nMalplena tranĉo, kies longo estas 0\n\n\n\n1.3.4. Statika tabelo\nMalkiel tranĉo, statika tabelo estas stokita en la stako anstataŭ sur\nla amaso. Por ke tio eblas, la longo de statika tabelo devas esti\nkonata je la momento de la kompilado. La sintakso uzata por krei\nstatikajn tabelojn estas proksima al tiu de asigno de tranĉo, sed\nsen la ĉefvorto new.\nimport std::io\n\n/**\n  * Akceptas statikan tabelon de longo 12\n  */\ndef foo (a : [i32 ; 12]) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    let mut a : [mut i32 ; 12] = [0 ; 12];\n\n    for i in 0 .. 12\n        a [i] = i\n\n    let b = [1; 12];\n\n    foo (a);\n    foo (b);\n}\n\n\nStatika tabelo povas esti transformita al tranĉo uzante la ĉefvortoj\nalias, copy aŭ dcopy.

Unuforma sintakso de voko1. Funkcioj\nFunkcioj estas vaste akceptita koncepto por dividi programon en etajn\npartojn. Ymir programo ĉiam komencas per la main (ĉefa\nesperante) funkcio, kiun ni jam vidis en antaŭaj ĉapitroj. Ĉiuj\nfunkcioj estas deklaritaj per la vorto def sekvita per nomo, kaj\nlisto da parametroj. Oni vokas funkcion per ĝia nomo sekvita de listo\nda parametroj apartigitaj per komoj.\nimport std::io \n\n/** \n * La 'main' funkcio estas la enirejo de la programo\n * Ĝi povas havi neniun parametron, kaj redonas i32'a aŭ void'a valoron.\n */\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\n\n/** \n * Deklaro de funkcio nomita 'foo', kiu havas neniun parametron\n */\ndef foo () {\n    println (\"Foo\");\n\n    bar (); \n}\n\n\n/**\n * Deklaro de funkcio nomita 'bar', kiu havas unu parametron 'x' de tipo 'i32'\n */\ndef bar (x : i32) {\n    println (\"Bar \", x);\n}\n\n\nLa sintakso de deklaro de funkcio estas prezentata en la sekva bloko.\nfunkcio := ŝablona_funkcio | simpla_funkcio\nsimpla_funkcio := 'def' Nomo parametroj ('->' tipo)? esprimo\nŝablona_funkcio := 'def' ('if' esprimo) Nomo ŝablonaj_parametroj parametroj ('->' tipo)? esprimo\n\nparametroj := '(' (var_dekl (',' var_dekl)*)?

La simboloj estas difinitaj per la kompilado unue, antaŭ ol\nĝi kontrolas ilin, do malkiel C kaj similaj programlingvoj, kvankam la\nfunkcio foo estas deklarita post la main funkcio (en la\nunua ekzemplo de tiu ĉapitro), ĝia simbolo estas atingebla de la\nmain funkcio, kiu do povas voki ĝin. Pliaj informoj pri deklaro\nde simboloj, kaj atingebleco estas prezentataj en la ĉapitro\nPakoj.\n1.1. Parametroj\nLa parametroj de funkcio estas deklaritaj post la nomo, inter rondaj\nkrampoj. La sintakso de deklaro de parametro estas simila al la\nsintakso de deklaro de variablo, krom la vorto let kiu estas\nellasita. Tamen, malkiel deklaro de variablo, parametro devas havi\ntipon, kaj ĝia valoro estas maldeviga.\nimport std::io \n\n/**\n * Deklaro de funckio 'foo' kun unu parametro 'x' de tipo 'i32'\n */\ndef foo (x : i32) {\n    println (\"La valoro de x estas : \", x);\n}\n\n/**\n * Deklaro de funkcio 'bar' kun du parametroj 'x' kaj 'y' ambaŭ de tipo 'i32'\n */\ndef bar (x : i32, y : i32) {\n    println (\"La valoro de x + y : \", x + y);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (5); // Vokas la funkcion 'foo', kun la valoro '5' por la parametro 'x' \n    bar (3, 4); // Vokas la funkcion 'bar', kun 'x' fiksita al '3' kaj, 'y' fiksita al '4'\n}\n\n\n1.1.1. Apriora valoro\nParametro de funkcio povas havi valoron, kiu estas uzita kiel apriora\nvaloro kiam oni vokas la funkcion. Tiam, estas maldeviga fiksi valoron\npor la parametroj, kiuj havas aprioran valoron. Por ŝanĝi la valoron\nasociita al tia parametro, oni enkondukas novan sintakson, nomita la\nnoma esprimo. Tiu esprimo, kies sintakso estas prezentata en la\nsekva kodbloko, konsistas en nomi esprimon.\nnoma_esprimo: Nomo '->' esprimo\n\nLa sekva ekzemplo prezentas funkcion foo, kies parametro x\nhavas aprioran valoron. La funkcio main vokas ĝin, unue uzante\nla aprioran valoron de x, kaj due uzante noman esprimon.\nimport std::io\n\n/**\n * Funkcio 'foo' povas esti vokita sen fiksi valoron por la parametro 'x'\n * Tiam, '8' estos uzita kiel la apriora valoro de 'x'\n */\ndef foo (x : i32 = 8) {\n    println (\"The value of x is : \", x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (); // Vokas 'foo' kun 'x' fiksita al '8'\n    foo (x-> 7); // Vokas 'foo', kun 'x' fiksita al '7'\n}\n\n\nNoma esprimo povas ankaŭ esti uzita por parametroj, kiuj ne havas\naprioran valoron. Danke al la noma esprimo, eblas voki funkcion sen\nzorgi pri la ordo de la argumentoj.\nimport std::io\n\n\n/**\n * Parametroj kun apriora valoro ne bezonas esti la lastaj.\n * Tiu funkcio povas esti vokita kun nur du parametroj ('x' kaj 'z'), aŭ uzante noman esprimon\n */\ndef foo (x : i32, y : i32 = 9, z : i32) {\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    // Vokas la funkcion 'foo', kun 'x' = 2, 'y' = 1 kaj 'z' = 8 \n    foo (8, y-> 1, x-> 2);\n    foo (1, 8); // Vokas la funkcion 'foo' kun 'x' = 1, y = '9' kaj z = '8'\n}\n\n\nRezultoj:\n2 1 8\n1 9 8\n\nIu ajn kompleksa esprimo povas esti uzita kiel la apriora valoro de\nparametro. Kreo de objekto, voko de funkcio, kodbloko, ktp. La sola\nlimo estas ke oni ne povas referi al la aliaj parametroj de la\nfunkcio. Fakte, ili ne ankoraŭ estas konsideritaj kiel deklaritaj, je\nla momento de la voko.\ndef foo (x : i32) -> i32 { ... }\ndef bar (x : i32) -> i32 { ... }\n\ndef baz (a : i32, b : i32 = {bar (1) + foo (2)}) {\n // ...\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    baz (12); // Vokas 'baz', kun 'a' = 12 kaj b = (bar (1) + foo (2))\n}\n\n\nLa simboloj uzitaj en la apriora valoro de parametro devas esti\natingeblaj je la kunteksto de la deklaro de ties funkcio. Tio volas\ndiri ke, en la lasta ekzemplo, la funkcio baz devas povi atingi\nla funkciojn bar kaj foo, tamen ne bezonas ke la funkcio\nmain, kiu vokas la baz funkcion, povas atingi tiujn du\nfunkciojn. Pliaj informoj pri deklaro de simboloj kaj atingebleco\nestas prezentataj en la ĉapitro\nPakoj.\n1.1.2. Rikura apriora valoro\nRikuro en apriora valoro estas malpermesita. Por ilustri tiun punkton,\nla sekva kodbloko prezentas ekzemplon, kiun la kompililo rifuzos.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (foo_a : i32 = bar ()) -> i32 {\n                    // ^^^ tie, la valoro estas rikura\n    foo_a\n}\n\ndef bar (bar_a : i32 = foo ()) -> i32 {\n                    // ^^^ rikura problemo\n\n    println (\"Bar \", bar_a);\n    foo (foo_a-> bar_a + 11) \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Main \", bar ()); // ne bezonas ke oni fiksu la valoron de 'bar_a'\n}\n\n\nEraroj:\nError : the call operator is not defined for main::bar and {}\n --> main.yr:(3,28)\n 3  ┃ def foo (foo_a : i32 = bar ()) -> i32 {\n    ╋                            ^^\n    ┃ Note : candidate bar --> main.yr:(8,5) : main::bar (bar_a : i32)-> i32\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(3,10)\n    ┃  3  ┃ def foo (foo_a : i32 = bar ()) -> i32 {\n    ┃     ╋          ^^^^^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(8,24)\n    ┃  8  ┃ def bar (bar_a : i32 = foo ()) -> i32 {\n    ┃     ╋                        ^^^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(8,10)\n    ┃  8  ┃ def bar (bar_a : i32 = foo ()) -> i32 {\n    ┃     ╋          ^^^^^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(3,24)\n    ┃  3  ┃ def foo (foo_a : i32 = bar ()) -> i32 {\n    ┃     ╋                        ^^^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━\n\n\nTiu rikura problemo povas esti simple solvita, per fiksi valoron al la\nparametro bar_a, kiu ne dependas de la valoro de foo_a,\nkiam oni vokas la funkcion bar kiel la apriora valoro de\nfoo_a.\ndef foo (foo_a : i32 = bar (bar_a-> 20)) -> i32 {\n                    //      ^^^^^ tio resolvas la problemon\n    foo_a\n}\n\n// Ne bezonas ke oni faru same por la funkcio 'bar', la problemo estas jam solvita\n\n\nRezultoj: \nBar 20\nBar 31\nMain 42\n1.1.3. Parametroj de la funkcio 'main'\nLa funkcio main povas havi unu parametron. Tiu parametro estas\nde tipo [[c8]], kaj enhavas la liston de argumentoj donitaj al\nla programo, kiam ĝi estas lanĉita.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main (args : [[c8]]) {\n    println (args);\n}\n\n\nRezultoj: \n$ ./a.out foo bar 1\n[./a.out, foo, bar, 1]\n\nLa norma biblioteko provizas analizilo de argumentoj en\nstd::args, kiu ne estos prezentita tie, sed kiu valoras mencion.\n1.2. Korpo de funkcio\nLa korpo de funkcio estas esprimo. Ĉiuj esprimoj en Ymir havas\ntipon, sed tiu ne volas diri ke ĉiuj esprimoj havas valoron, ĉar ili\npovas esti de tipo void. La valoro de la esprimo (korpo de la\nfunkcio) estas komputita, kiam oni eniras la funkcion, kaj tiu valoro\nestas uzita kiel la valoro de la funkcio. Simple aldoni funkcio\npovas esti skribita jene :\ndef aldoni (x : i32, y : i32)-> i32 \n    x + y\n\n\nAŭ uzante pli kompleksa esprimo, kiel kodbloko, kiu estas esprimo\nenhavata liston da esprimoj. Kodbloko estas ĉirkaŭita de kunigaj\nkrampoj, kaj estis prezntita en la ĉapitro pri vivdaŭro kaj lokaj\nvariabloj. La lasta esprimo de kodbloko estas la esprimo uzita por\nkomputi la valoron de la kodbloko, do, en tiu ĉi okazo, la valoro de\nla funkcio.\n\ndef aldoni (x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 { // Komenco de kodbloko\n    x + y // la lasta esprimo de la bloko estas la valoro de la bloko\n} // fino de kodbloko\n\ndef main () \n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let x = {\n        let y = aldoni (1, 2);\n        y + 8 \n    };\n    assert (x == 11);\n}\n\nPunktokomo ; difinas ke esprimo finas en bloko, kaj ke sia\nvaloro devas esti ignorita. Se la lasta esprimo de kodbloko finas per\npunktokomo, do malplena esprimo estas aldonita en la kodbloko. Tiu\nmalplena esprimo havas neniun valoron, kaj estas de tipo void.\n\n/**\n * La valoro de la funckio estas '9'\n */\ndef foo () -> i32 \n    9\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = {\n         foo (); // Vokas la funckion 'foo', sed sia valoro estas ignorita\n    } // La valoro de la bloko estas de tipo 'void'\n}\n\n\nĈar estas neebla deklari variablon, kies tipo estas void, pro ke\nĝi havas neniun valoron, la supra ekzemplo ne estas akceptita per la\nkompililo. La eraro donita de la kompililo estas prezentata en la\nmalsupra kodbloko. Oni povas noti ke malgraŭe, variabloj kun neniu\nvaloro estas deklareblaj, sed ilia tipo devas esti malplena opo, ne\nvoid, kies litero estas ().\nError : cannot declare var of type void\n --> main.yr:(6,9)\n    | \n 6  |     let x = {\n    |         ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.3. Tipo de redona valoro de funkcio\nKiam la valoro de la korpo de funkcio ne estas de tipo void, la\nfunkcio havas valoron, kaj tipon. Tiu tipo devas esti deklarita je la\nprototipo de la funkcio, tiel ke ĝi estas videbla de la aliaj funkcioj\nkiuj povas voki ĝin. La deklaro de la tipo estas farita uzante la\nsigno sago -> tuj post la deklaro de la parametroj de la\nfunkcio. La redona tipo de la funkcio povas esti forgestia se la\nvaloro de la korpo de la funkcio estas de tipo void, sed devas\nĉiam esti deklarita alie.\ndef foo (x : i32)-> i32 \n    x + 1\n\ndef bar (x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 {\n    let z = x + y;\n    println (\"La valoro de z : \", z);\n    foo (z)\n}\n\n\nNe ĉiam estas facila deklari korpo de funkcio tiel maniere ke ĝi\ngvidas al la bona valoro, kiam estas multe da branĉoj. Por eviti\nmultvorteco, kaj redoni valoron anticipe, la ĉefvorto return\n(redoni) povas esti uzita. Ĝi fermas la funkcion kaj redonas valoron\nkiu oni deklaras en la esprimo tuj post la ĉefvorto. La return\nesprimo ankaŭ povas redoni void valoro en void funkcio,\nkiam ĝia asociita esprimo estas de tipo void. La tipo de la\nvaloro de la esprimo asociita al redona esprimo devas esti de la\nsama tipo ol la tipo deklarita en la prototipo de la funkcio.\ndef estasDividebla (x : i32, z : i32) -> bool {\n    if (z == 0) return false; \n\n    (x % z) == 0\n}\n\n\nLa kompililo certigas ke ĉiuj branĉoj de la funkcia korpo gvidas al\nredona esprimo aŭ al valoro kies tipo estas la sama ol la tipo de la\nfunkcio. Se la korpo de la funkcio povas gvidi al valoro kies tipo\nestas malsama ol la tipo de la funkcio, kaj eblas ke neniu redona\nesprimo estas uzita, tiam la kompililo ĵetas eraron.\nimport std::io\n\ndef aldoni_unu (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    x + 1; // La valoro de la bloko estas void, pro la ';' \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = aldoni_unu (5); \n    println (\"La valoro de x : \", x);\n}\n\n\nEn la supra fontkodo, la funkcio aldoni_unu havas korpon de tipo\nvoid, kiam la prototipo de la funkcio deklaras ke la funkcio\nredonas valoron de tipo i32, aldone ne estas redona esprimo en\nla funkcio, do la kompililo ĵetas eraron.\nError : incompatible types i32 and void\n --> main.yr:(3,32)\n 3  ┃ def aldoni_unu (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    ╋                                ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(5,1)\n    ┃  5  ┃ }\n    ┃     ╋ ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.4. Lokaj deklaracioj\nKodbloko ankaŭ malfermas ia loka pakaĵo, en kiu oni povas deklari\nsimbolojn. Tiuj deklaracioj povas esti aliaj funkcioj, strukturoj,\nklasoj, enumeracioj, ktp. Tiuj deklaracioj, kiujn oni faras en loka\nkodbloko, ne povas atingi la lokajn variablojn, kiuj ankaŭ estas\ndeklaritaj en la loka kodbloko. Atingebleco estas ebla per uzi\ntegaĵojn (kp. Altnivela\nfunkcioj),\nsed tio ne estas prezentata en tiu ĉapitro.\ndef foo () {\n    import std::io;     // importo estas loka al foo\n    let x = 12;\n    {\n        def bar () -> i32 {\n            println (x);\n            12\n        }\n        println (x + bar ());\n    }\n\n    // bar ne plu estas atingebla\n    bar (); // malkompilebla\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n\n    bar ();\n    println (\"En la main funkcio !\");\n}\n\n\nEn la lasta ekzemplo, la bar funkcio estas atingebla en la\namplekso malfermita al la linio 4, ĝi la linio 10.

Unuforma sintakso de voko\nLa unuforma sintakso de voko estas la sintakso kiu permesas voki\nfunkciojn per la punkta operatoro ..

En la sekva ekzemplo, la for buklo\nestas uzita por iteracii trans tri intervaloj. La unua buklo je la\nkvara linio, iteracias inter la valoroj 0 kaj 8\n(malinkluzivita), je paŝo de 2.

Opoj estas iteracieblaj tipoj. Sed malkiel\ntranĉoj aŭ intervaloj, la for buklo estas disvolvita dum la\nkompilado. La opoj estas iteracieblaj kun nur unu variablo, kiu estas\nasociata al la valoroj enhavitaj de la opoj.\nimport std::io \n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (1, 'r');\n    for i in x { \n        println (i);\n    }\n\n    // supra buklo estas ekvivalenta al \n    println (x.0);\n    println (x.1);\n}\n\n\nOni povas noti ke la tipo de la variablo i, en la for buklo de\nla supra ekzemplo, ŝanĝas de unu iteracio al la alia, estinte\ni32 tipo, kaj poste c32 tipo je la sekva iteracio.

Reference1.1. Reference as function parameter1.2. Reference as a value1.3. Reference as function return1. Reference\nThe keywordref is a keyword that is placed before the\ndeclaration of a variable. It is used to refer to a value, which is\nusually borrowed from another variable. They are performing similar\noperation as\nPointers,\nwith the difference that they does not need to be dereferenced (this\nis done automatically), and pointer arithmetics is not possible with\nreferences. In Ymir references are always set, and are always set\nfrom another variable, hence they are way safer than pointers, and\nmust be prefered to them when possible.\ndef foo () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let ref y = ref x;\n    //          ^^^    \n    // Try to remove the keyword ref.\n}\n\n\nThe above program can be represented in memory as shown in the\nfollowing figure.\n\n\n\nIn this figure, one can note that y, is a pointer to x, which\ncan be used as if it was directly x. This means that y\nmust have the same mutability properties (or lower) as x. And\nthat if x is mutable, changing the value of y would also\nchange x.\nA first example of reference is presented in the following source\ncode. In this example, a mutable variable x contains a value of\ntype i32. This value is placed on the stack, as it is not a\naliasable type. Then a variable y is constructed as a reference\nof the variable x. Modifying y in the following example, also\nmodifies x.\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let mut x = 12; // place a value of type i32 and value 12 on the stack\n    let ref mut y = ref x; // create a reference of x\n    y = 42; // modify the value pointed by the reference\n    assert (x == 42);\n}\n\n\nA more complexe example is presented in the following source code. In\nthis example, a deeply mutable array x is created. This array is\na reference on borrowed data in the heap. A deeply mutable reference\ny is the, made on that variable x, which is allowed\nbecause x is also deeply mutable and the mutability level of\nx and y are the same.

Reference as function parameter\nA parameter of a function can be a reference.

In this case, you should always specify that you pass the\nvariable by reference, to distinguish it from the function that passes\nthe variable directly by value. In practice, due to the existence of\naliasable types, which will be discussed in the next chapter, you will\nnever gain anything by doing this.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo ( x : i32) {\n//       ^\n// Try to add mut here\n    println (\"By value : \", x);\n}\n\ndef foo (ref x : i32) {\n    println (\"By reference : \", x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 89;\n    foo (x);\n    foo (ref x);\n}\n\nResults:\nBy value : 89\nBy reference : 89\n\nIf you have done the exercise, and added the keyword mut to the\nsignature of the first function foo, you should get the following\nerror: \nError : a parameter cannot be mutable, if it is not a reference\n --> main.yr:(3,15)\n 3  ┃ def foo (mut  x : i32) {\n    ╋               ^\n\n\nThis error means that the type of x is not aliasable, so if it is not\na reference, marking it as mutable will have no effect on the program,\nso the compiler does not allow it.\n1.2.

We\nconsider the data to have an owner only once it has been assigned to a\nvariable.\nThere are other kinds of alias that are implicitly allowed, such\nas code blocks or function calls. Those are implicit because\nthe alias is already made within the value of these elements.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> dmut [i32] {\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    alias x // alias is done here and mandatory\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let x = foo (); // no need to alias, it must have been done in the function\n    assert (x == [1, 2, 3]);\n}\n\n\n1.1. Alias a function parameter\nAs you have noticed, the keyword alias, unlike the keyword ref,\ndoes not characterize a variable. The type of a variable will indicate\nwhether the type should be passed by alias or not, so there is no\nchange in the definition of the function. When the type of a parameter\nis an aliasable type, this parameter can be mutable without being a\nreference.\nimport std::io\n\n// The function foo will be allowed to modify the internal values of y\ndef foo (mut y : [mut i32])\n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    y [0] = y [1];\n    y = [8, 3, 4]; // has no impact on the x of main,\n    // y is a reference to the data borrowed not to the variable x itself\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &OutOfArray, &AssertError\n{\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    foo (alias x);\n    //   ^^^^^\n    // Try to remove the alias\n    assert (x == [2, 2, 3]);\n}\n\n\nAs with the variable, if the function parameter cannot affect the\nvalues that are borrowed, the alias keyword is not required.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (x : [i32]) {\n    println (x); // just reads the borrowed data, but doesn't modify them\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];    \n    foo (x); // no need to alias\n}\n\n\n1.1.1. Alias in uniform call syntax\nWe have seen in the function chapter, the uniform call syntax. This\nsyntax is used to call a function using the dot operator ., by\nputting the first parameter of the function on the left of the\noperation. When the first parameter is of an aliasable type, the first\nargument must be aliased explicitely, leading to a strange and verbose\nsyntax.\nlet dmut a = [1, 2, 3];\n(alias a).foo (12); // same a foo (alias a, 12);\n\n\nTo avoid verbosity, we added the operator :., to use the\nuniform call syntax with an aliasable first parameter. \nlet dmut a = [1, 2, 3];\na:.foo (12); // same as foo (alias a, 12);\n\n\nThis operator is very usefull when dealing with classes, where the\nuniform call syntax is mandatory, as we will see in chapter\nClass.\n1.2. Special case of struct and tuple\nIn the chapter\nStructure\nyou will learn how to create a structure containing several fields of\ndifferent types. You have already learned how to make tuples. These\ntypes are sometimes aliasable, depending on the internal type they\ncontain. If a tuple, or a structure, has a field whose type is aliasable,\nthen the tuple or structure is also aliasable.\nThe table below presents some examples of aliasable tuples : \n\n\n\nType\nAliasable\nReason\n\n\n\n\n(i32, i32)\nfalse\ni32 is not aliasable\n\n\n([i32],)\ntrue\n[i32] is a slice, and hence aliasable\n\n\n([i32], f64)\ntrue\n[i32] is a slice, and hence aliasable\n\n\n(([i32], i32), f64)\ntrue\n[i32] is a slice, and hence aliasable\n\n\n\nIn the introduction of this chapter we presented the notion of\nMutability\nlevel. One\ncan note that mutability level is not suitable for tuple, as aliasable\ntuple are trees of type and not simply a list. However, this does not\nchange much, the compiler just check the mutability level of the inner\ntypes of the tuple, recursively.\n"},"advanced/copies.html":{"url":"advanced/copies.html","title":"Copy and Deep copy","keywords":"","body":"1. Copy data to make them mutable1.1. Copy1.2. Deep copy1. Copy data to make them mutable\nSometimes it is not possible to allow data to be borrowed by foreign\nfunctions or variables. This can be due to the facts that data are\nimmutable for example. To solve this problem, Ymir provides two\nkeywords, copy and dcopy.\n1.1. Copy\nThe copy keyword makes a copy of the first level of a value,\nwhose type is aliasable. This copy transform an immutable type into a\nmutable one, by increasing its mutability level by one. The following\ntable shows some examples of the types of copied values :\n\n\n\nType\nType of copied value\n\n\n\n\n[i32]\nmut [mut i32]\n\n\nmut [i32]\nmut [mut i32]\n\n\nmut [[i32]]\nmut [mut [i32]]\n\n\n\nAn example of what can be achieved by copy keyword is shown in\nthe following code. The representation of the memory is also shown in\nthe figure underneath. In this example, the variable x is copied\nand the result value is placed in the variable y. In this\nexample, each variable are borrowing different data placed on the\nheap, whose values are equivalent.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError, &OutOfArray\n{\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let dmut y = copy x; // create a copy of x\n    assert (x == y); // y and x have the same value, but at different location\n\n    y [0] = 9; \n    assert (x == [1, 2, 3]); // modifying y does not affect x\n    assert (y == [9, 2, 3]); // but still affects y\n}\n\n\nWe can see from the figure below, that the variable y points to\ndata at a different location, from the data pointed by x. This\nimplies a new memory allocation, and a memory copy, that cost some cpu\ntime, and memory place. For that reason, copies are never hidden by\nthe language, and are made only when the keyword copy is placed\nin the source code.\n\nExercise : Modify x that is initialised with an imutable string literal : \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray \n{\n    let x = \"hello !\";\n    x [0] = 'H'; // Make this line work\n    assert (x == \"Hello !\");\n}\n\n Correction (spoiler) : \n\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray, &AssertError\n{\n\tlet dmut x = copy \"hello !\";\n\tx [0] = 'H'; // Well done\n\tassert (x == \"Hello !\");\n}\n\n\n1.2. Deep copy\nThe deep copy will make a copy of the value and all internal values,\nit must be used in special cases because it is much less efficient\nthan the simple copy, which copies only one level of the data. There\nis nothing complex to understand in deep copy, it simply creates a\nvalue, deeply mutable, which is an exact copy.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = [[1], [2, 3], [4]];\n    let dmut y = dcopy x;\n    let mut z : [mut [i32]] = copy x;\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z);\n}\n\n\nThe structure of the copy respect the structure of the initial value\nthat has been copied, meaning that even recursive values can be copied\nwithout any worries. To make recursive values, we need to use objects,\nthat are described in the chapter\nObjects, and\ntraits described in the chapter\nTraits\nto make the objects deeply copiable. To avoid the scattering of the\ninformation, we will assume that you will have already read these\nchapters and came back here to understand the deep copy on objects.\nIn the following example, the object A contains a field of type\nA. The initialization of this field is made using the either\nself or another object in the constructor defined at line\n1 and 2. Thus the state of the memory in the main\nfunction, at line 1 can be described by the figure depicted just\nunderneath the source code.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass A {\n\n    let _i : i32;\n    let dmut _a : &A;\n\n    pub self (i : i32, dmut a : &A) with _a = alias a, _i = i {\n        self._a._a = alias self;\n    }\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with _a = alias self, _i = i {}\n\n    impl Copiable, Streamable; // to make A deep copiable, and printable\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut a = A::new (1);\n    let dmut b = A::new (2, alias a);\n\n    println (a);\n    println (b);\n}\n\n\nResults:\nmain::A(1, main::A(2, main::A(...)))\nmain::A(2, main::A(1, main::A(...)))\n\nMemory state at line 20 : \n\nNow let's add a deep copy of the value contained inside the variable\na into a variable c. This deep copy copies the values of\nthe object inside a, and the object inside the field _a,\nthe copy is recursive, and correctly keeps the structure.\nlet c = dcopy a;\n\nThe following figure represents the memory state of the program after\nthe deep copy.\n\n"},"advanced/best.html":{"url":"advanced/best.html","title":"Best practice","keywords":"","body":"1. Best practice1. Best practice\nThe copy is never hidden in the source code that is available to the\nuser. However, many codes that we are using on a daily basis, are\nprovided by libraries. In libraries, only the prototypes of the\nfunctions are presented to the user, and therefore if a copy is made\ninside a function, the copy is hidden from the user. We cannot\nguarantee that such copy are not made (at least for the moment), so we\npropose a best practice advice to avoid hidden copies inside\nlibraries.\nThis advice is simple, never take a immutable parameter in a function,\nif you have to make a copy of it inside the function. For example, let\nsay we have a function that sorts a slice. This function should\npreferably take a mutable slice as input and modify it directly.\ndef good (dmut slc : [i32])-> dmut [i32] {\n    // perform the sort on slc\n    alias slc\n}\n\ndef bad (slc : [i32])-> dmut [i32] {\n    let dmut res = copy slc;\n    // perform the sort on res\n    alias res}\n\n\nThis way, the function calling the sort function has the choice of\nmaking the copy or not. In the following example, the user has the\nchoice when calling the function good, but never when calling\nthe function bad, making the copy hidden. One can note from the\nfollowing example, that the copy is never hidden when calling\ngood, and that it is also possible to make no copy at all.\ndef main () {\n    let dmut slc = [9, 3, 7];\n    let dmut aux = good (copy slc); // slc is unchanged, and aux is sorted\n    let dmut slc2 = good (alias slc); // slc is sorted, and slc2 points the data of slc\n\n    good (slc); // impossible, implicit alias is not allowed\n\n    bad (slc); // here there is not need for alias, nor copy, \n               // the data of slc won't be modified in bad\n               // the copy is alway made and hidden\n}\n\n\nFrom the above example, the compiler returns an error, when trying to\ncall the function good without aliasing nor copying at line\n6. This error prevents from copying values implicitely without\nwritting it down, nor making aliasing of the values and giving the\nwrite permission to foreign functions without informing the compiler\nof our agreement. All the other calls are valid, the wish of the user\nbeing totally explicit.\nError : the call operator is not defined for main::good and {mut [mut i32]}\n --> main.yr:(17,7)\n17  ┃     good (slc); // impossible, implicit alias is not allowed\n    ╋          ^   ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate good --> main.yr:(1,5) : main::good (slc : mut [mut i32])-> mut [mut i32]\n    ┃     ┃ Error : discard the constant qualifier is prohibited, left operand mutability level is 2 but must be at most 1\n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(17,8)\n    ┃     ┃ 17  ┃     good (slc); // impossible, implicit alias is not allowed\n    ┃     ┃     ╋           ^^^\n    ┃     ┃     ┃ Note : implicit alias of type mut [mut i32] is not allowed, it will implicitly discard constant qualifier\n    ┃     ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(17,8)\n    ┃     ┃     ┃ 17  ┃     good (slc); // impossible, implicit alias is not allowed\n    ┃     ┃     ┃     ╋           ^^^\n    ┃     ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┃     ┃ Note : for parameter slc --> main.yr:(1,16) of main::good (slc : mut [mut i32])-> mut [mut i32]\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nContribution: Maybe it is possible to complitely avoid hidden copies ?

Purity and the pure keyword1. Pure values\nA pure value is a value that cannot change. In other word it is a\nvalue, that ensure that there is no variable in the program that has a\nmutable access to it. Pure values are different to const values, in\nthe sense that const values just give the garantee that the current\naccess is not mutable, however they does not garantee that there is no\nother variable in the program with mutable access.\nThe different guarantees on values can be listed as follows : \n\nNo garantee, the value is mutable mut\nGarantee that the value is no writable in the current context const \nGarantee that the value is completely immutable in every context pure\n\n1.1. Limitation of const values\nTo understand the limitation of const values, the following\nprogram has two variable defined in the function main. The first\none a has a mutable access to the value, and the variable\nb has a const access to the same value. Because the variable\na modifies the value, the value pointed by b is also\nmodified even if it was const. Thus, it is important to\nunderstand that const is only referering to the permission of\nthe variable b.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut a = [1, 2, 3];\n    let b = a;\n\n    a [0] = 98;\n\n    println (b);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n[98, 2, 3]\n\nWe have seen in a previous chapter that the keywords copy and\ndcopy can be used to remove this limitation, and ensure that the\nvalue of b is the same as the value of a, but that\nmodifying the value of a does not modify the value of\nb. This mechanism is the base of the one provided by pure\nvalues.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    let dmut a = [1, 2, 3];\n    let b = dcopy a;\n\n    a [0] = 98;\n\n    println (b);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n[1, 2, 3]\n\nNow let's add a third variable to the equation, and let's name it\nc. In this variable we want to store the value of b, and\nensure that the variable is never modified. If the initialization of\nthe variable b is made in an obscure way (for example in a\nfunction that is not readable, here the foo function), then the\nonly way to ensure that the value of c is never modified, is to\nmake a copy of it inside the value of c. If the memory movement\nare easy in the following example, it may not be the case in complex\nprogram with many variable and memory movement.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (a : [i32])-> [i32] {\n    a\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    let dmut a = [1, 2, 3];\n    let b = foo (a);\n\n    let c = dcopy b;\n    let d = b;\n\n    a [0] = 98;\n\n    println (c);\n    println (d);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n[1, 2, 3]\n[98, 2, 3]\n1.2.

In that case, the compiler\nchecks the initialization of the values that are used, and ensure that\nthey came from a deep copy, or another pure value.\ndef foo (a : [i32]) -> [i32] {\n    a\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray \n{\n    let dmut a = [1, 2, 3];\n\n    let pure b = foo (a);\n}\n\n\nError : discard the constant qualifier is prohibited\n --> main.yr:(10,11)\n10  ┃     let pure b = foo (a);\n    ╋              ^\n    ┃ Note : implicit pure of type [i32] is not allowed, it will implicitly discard constant qualifier\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(10,19)\n    ┃ 10  ┃     let pure b = foo (a);\n    ┃     ╋                      ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n To avoid the above error, there is two possibilities. Either we\nadd a dcopy on the function call of foo, or we add\npure to the return type of foo and make a deep copy of the\nvalue of a in this function. The function bar of the\nfollowing example perform the second possibility.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (a : [i32])-> [i32] {\n    a\n}\n\ndef bar (a : [i32])-> pure [i32] {\n    return dcopy a;\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray \n{\n    let dmut a = [1, 2, 3];\n    let pure b = dcopy foo (a);\n\n    let pure c = bar (a);\n\n    let pure d = b;\n    let pure e = c;\n\n    a [0] = 98;\n\n    println (d);\n    println (e);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n[1, 2, 3]\n[1, 2, 3]\n One can note that not copy are needed to move the value contained\nin the variable c into the variable e.

Example1.4. Symbol conflict resolution1.5. Public importation1.5.1. Best practice1.6. Include directory1.7. Compilation of modules1. Modules\nWhen creating a large project, it is very important to organize your\ncode. Ymir offers a system of modules, which is used to manage\ndifferent parts of the code that have different purposes. Each source\nfile in Ymir is a module.\n1.1. File hierarchy\nLets have a look at the following file hierarchy : \n.\n├── main.yr\n└── extern_modules\n    ├── bar.yr\n    └── foo.yr\n\n1 directory, 3 files\n\nIn this file hierarchy there are three files, which contain modules, the\nfirst module in the file main.yr will be named main. The second\none in the extern_modules/bar.yr file will be named extern_modules::bar,\nand the third one in the extern_modules/foo.yr file will be named\nextern_modules::foo.\nTo be properly importable, the module must be defined from the\nrelative path of the compilation, i.e. if the file is located in\n$(pwd)/relative/path/to/file, its module name must be\nrelative::path::to::file.\nThe name of a module is defined by the first line of the source code,\nby keyword mod. If this line is not given by the user, the path of\nthe module will only be the file name, so you will not always be able\nto import the module, depending on its relative path. You can consider\nthis line mandatory for the moment. \nFor example, in the file foo.yr, the first line must look like : \nmod extern_modules::foo\n\n\nAnd, it will therefore be importable everywhere, for example in the\nmain module, when writing the import declaration :\nimport extern_modules::foo\n\n \nThe syntax of the import statement is the following :\nimport_statement := 'import' path (',' path)* (';')?\npath := Identifier ('::' Identifier)* ('::' '_')?\n\n1.2. Sub modules\nSub modules are local modules, declared inside a global modules, are\ninside another sub module. Unlike global module, the access to the\nsymbols defined inside them is not implicit. For that reason they have\nto be explicitely mentionned when trying to access to their\nsymbols. This mention is done with the double colon binary operator\n::, where the first operand is the name of the module, and the\nsecond the name of the symbol to access.\nmod main\nimport std::io;\n\nmod InnerModule {\n\n    pub def foo () {\n        println (\"Foo\");\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    InnerModule::foo (); // access of the function declared in InnerModule\n}\n\nThe access operator ::, can also be used to access to symbols\ndeclared inside global modules. This will be discussed after talking\nabout privacy of symbols.\n1.3. Privacy\nAll symbols defined in a module are private by default. The privacy of\na given symbol s refer to the possibility for foreign modules, and\nsymbols to access to this given symbol s. When a symbol s is\ndeclared private in a module s, then only the other symbols of the\nmodule m have access to it. Module privacy can be seen as a tree,\nwhere a global module is a root, and module symbols are the branches\nand leaves of the tree. In such a tree, symbols have access to their\nparent, siblings, and the siblings of their parents. \nIn the following figure an example of a module tree is presented,\nwhere a global module named A, has three symbols, 2 sub modules\nA::X and A::Y, and a function A::foo. In this tree, we assume\nthat every symbols are declared private. For that reason, the function\nA::foo has access to A, A::X, A::Y, but not to A::X::bar,\nnor A::Y::baz. The symbol A::X::bar, has access to every symbols\n(A, A::X, A::Y, A::foo), except A::Y::baz.\n\n\n\nGlobal modules are always tree roots, for that reason they don't have\nparents. For example, the module extern_modules::foo, does not\nhave access to the symbols declared inside the module\nextern_modules, (if they are privates).\nThe keyword pub flag a symbol as public, and accessible by\nforeign modules. This keyword can be used as a block, or for only one\nsymbol. Its syntax grammar is presented in the following code block.\npub :=   'pub' '{' symbol* '}' \n       | 'pub' symbol\n\n1.3.1. Example\n1) Module extern_modules/foo.yr\nmod extern_modules::foo;\n\n/**\n * foo is public, it can be accessed from foreign modules\n */\npub def foo () {}\n\n/**\n * The bar function is private by default\n * Thus only usable in this module\n */\ndef bar () {}\n\n\n2) Module main.yr\n/**\n * This importation will give access to all the symbols in the module\n * 'extern_modules::foo' that have been declared 'public'\n */\nimport extern_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (); // foo is public we can call it\n    bar (); // however, bar is private thus not accessible\n}\n\nErrors:\nError : undefined symbol bar\n --> main.yr:(7,5)\n 7  ┃     bar (); // however, bar is private thus not accessible\n    ╋     ^^^\n    ┃ Note : bar --> extern_modules/foo.yr:(8,5) : extern_modules::foo::bar is private within this context\n    ┗━━━━━━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n1.4. Symbol conflict resolution\nWhen two external global modules declare two symbols with the same\nname, it may be impossible to know which symbol the user is refereing\nto. In this case, the double colon operator :: can be used with\nthe name of the module declaring the symbol to resolve the\nambiguity. To give an example of symbol conflict, let's say that we\nhave two module extern_modules::foo and extern_modules::bar\ndeclaring a function with the same signature foo.\n1) Module extern_modules/bar.yr\nmod extern_modules::bar\nimport std::io\n\npub def foo () {\n    println (\"Bar\");\n}\n\n\n2) Module extern_modules/foo.yr\nmod extern_modules::foo\nimport std::io\n\npub def foo () {\n    println (\"Foo\");\n}\n\n\nIn the main module, both modules extern_modules::bar and\nextern_modules::foo, are imported. The main function presented below\nrefers to the symbol foo. In that case, there is no way to tell\nwhich function will be used, extern_modules::foo::foo or\nextern_modules::bar::foo. The compiler returns an error. One can\nnote that this errors occurs only because the signature of the two\nfunction foo are the same (taking no parameters), and they are both\npublic. If there was a difference in their prototypes, for example if\nthe function in the module extern_modules::bar would take a value of\ntype i32 as parameter, the conflict would be resolved by itself, as\nthe call expression will be different.\n3) Module main.yr\nimport extern_modules::bar, extern_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\nErrors:\nError : {extern_modules::bar::foo ()-> void, extern_modules::foo::foo ()-> void, mod extern_modules::foo} x 3 called with {} work with both\n --> main.yr:(4,6)\n 4  ┃     foo ();\n    ╋         ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate foo --> extern_modules/bar.yr:(4,9) : extern_modules::bar::foo ()-> void\n    ┃ Note : candidate foo --> extern_modules/foo.yr:(4,9) : extern_modules::foo::foo ()-> void\n    ┗━━━━━━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n.page-inner {\n  width: 95%;\n}\nIn the above error, we can see that three modules are presented. The\ntwo functions foo — in extern_modules::bar, and\nextern_modules::foo — and the extern_modules::foo module\nitself. Obviously, it is not possible to use the call operator\n() on a module, that is why it is not presented as a possible\ncanditate in the notes of the error.\nThe conflict problem can be resolved by changing the calling\nexpression, and using the double colon operator ::. In the\nfollowing example, the full name of the module is used. This is not\nalways necessary, as bar::foo is sufficient to refer to\nextern_modules::bar::foo, and foo::foo for function\nfoo in extern_modules::foo.\nimport extern_modules::bar, extern_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    extern_modules::bar::foo (); \n    extern_modules::foo::foo (); \n\n    foo::foo (); \n    bar::foo ();\n}\n\nResults:\nBar\nFoo\nFoo\nBar\n\n1.5. Public importation\nAs for all declaration, importation are private. It means that the\nimportation is not recursive. For example, if the module\nextern_modules::foo imports the module extern_modules::bar, and the\nmodule main import the module extern_modules::foo, all the public\nsymbols declared in extern_modules::bar will not be accessible in the\nmodule main.\nYou can of course, make a pub importation, to make the symbols of\nthe module extern_modules::bar visible for the module main.\n1) Module extern_modules/bar.yr\nmod extern_modules::bar\nimport std::io\n\npub def bar () {\n    println (\"Bar\");\n}\n\n\n2) Module extern_modules/foo.yr\nmod extern_modules::foo\n\npub import extern_modules::bar\n\n\n3) Module main.yr\nmod main\nimport extern_modules::foo;\n\ndef main () {\n    bar ();\n}\n\n\nIn the example above, the function bar defined in the module\nextern_modules::bar, is imported (because the function is public\nis public) by the module extern_modules::foo. This importation\nis public, thus when the module main imports the module\nextern_modules::foo, it also imports the module\nextern_modules::bar, and has access to the function bar. \n1.5.1. Best practice\nPublic importation must be used with caution, to avoid polluting other\nmodules. A good practice, is to define some modules only to make\npublic importations. These modules should be named _. For\nexample, with our previous file hierarchy, a file\nextern_modules/_.yr would be added, and no public imports made\nin the modules extern_modules::foo, nor in the module\nextern_modules::bar.\nmod extern_modules::_;\n\npub import extern_modules::foo;\npub import extern_modules::bar;\n\n\nThese modules are not automatically generated by Ymir — even if it\nseems trivial —, to allow importing only a subset of the modules\ncontained in a sub directory. These importation modules are optional\nand left to the choice of the user.\n1.6. Include directory\nYou can use the -I option, to add a path to the include\ndirectory. This path will be used as if it was the current $(pwd). In\nother words, if you add the I -path/to/modules option, and you have a\nfile in path/to/modules/relative/to/my/file, the name of the module\nmust be relative::to::my::file.\ngyc -I ~/libs/ main.yr\n\nThis is how the standard library is included in the build, and how you\ncan access modules in std:: that are not located in $(pwd)/std/.\n1.7. Compilation of modules\nAll modules must be compiled, the import declaration is just a\ndirective of for symbols access, but does not compile the imported\nsymbols. For example, in the following example, there are two modules,\none declaring a function foo, and the other importing it and\ncalling it. \n1) Module main.yr\nmod main\nimport extern_modules::foo;\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\n\n2) Module extern_modules/foo.yr\nmod extern_modules::foo\n\npub def foo () {}\n\n\nBy compiling only the main function, the compiler returns a link\nerror. This error means that the symbol foo declared in the module\nextern_modules::foo was not found during the symbol linkage. \n$ gyc main.yr\n/tmp/ccCOeXDq.o: In function `_Y4mainFZv':\nmain.yr:(.text+0x3e): undefined reference to `_Y14extern_modules3foo3fooFZv'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nTo avoid this error, and create a valid executable, where all symbols\ncan be found, the module extern_modules::foo has to be compiled\nas well. GYC is able to manage object files (containing pre compiled\nsymbols), and compiled libraries.

Structure\nStructure is a common design used in many languages to define users'\ncustom types. They contains multiple values of different types,\naccessible by identifiers. Structures are similar to tuples, in terms\nof memory management (located in the stack). Unlike tuples, structures\nare named, and all their internal fields are named as well. \nThe complete grammar of structure definition is presented in the\nfollowing code block. One can note the possibility to add templates to\nthe definition of the structure. These templates will only be\ndiscussed in the chapter\nTemplates,\nand are not of interest to us at the moment.\nstruct_type := 'struct' ('|' var_decl)* '->' identifier (templates)?\nvar_decl := ('mut'?) identifier ':' type ('=' expression)?\nidentifier := ('_')* [A-z] ([A-z0-9_])*\n\n\nThe fields of the structure are defined using the same syntax as the\ndeclaration of function parameters, i.e. the same syntax as variable\ndeclaration but with the keyword let omitted. The following\nsource code presents a definition of a structure Point with two\nfields x and y of type i32. The two fields of this\nstructure are immutable, and have no default values.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n| y : i32 \n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let point = Point (1, 2); // initialize the value of the structure\n    println (point); // structures are printable\n}\n\n\nResults:\nmain::Point(1, 2)\n\nIt is possible to declare a structure with no fields. Note, however,\nthat such structure has a size of 1 byte in memory.\nContribution this is a limitation observed in gcc, maybe\nthis can be corrected ?\nimport std::io;\n\nstruct -> Unit;\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = Unit ();\n    println (x, \" of size \", sizeof (x));\n}\n\nResults:\nmain::Unit() of size 1\n1.1. Structure construction\nThe construction of a structure is made using the same syntax as a\nfunction call, that is to say using its identifier and a list of\nparameters inside parentheses and separated by comas. Like function\ncalls, structure can have default values assigneted to fields. The\nvalue of these fields can be changed using the named expression\nsyntax, which is constructed with the arrow operator ->. Field\nwithout default value can also be constructed using the named\nexpression syntax. In that case, the order of field construction is\nnot important.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32 = 0\n| y : i32 \n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let point = Point (y-> 12, x-> 98);\n    println (point);\n\n    let point2 = Point (1);\n    println (point2);\n}\n\nResults:\nmain::Point(98, 12)\nmain::Point(0, 1)\n\n1.2. Field access\nThe fields of a structure are always public, and accessible using the\ndot binary operator ., where the left operand is a value whose\ntype is a structure, and the right operand is the identifier of the\nfield.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n| y : i32 \n -> Point;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let point = Point (1, 2); \n    assert (point.x == 1 && point.y == 2);\n}\n\n1.3. Structure mutability\nThe mutability of a field of a structure is defined in the structure\ndeclaration. As with any variable declaration, the fields of a\nstructure are by default immutable. By adding the keyword mut\nbefore the identifier of a field, the field becomes mutable. However,\nthe mutability is transitive in Ymir, meaning that a immutable value\nof a struct type, cannot be modified even if its field are marked\nmutable. Consequently, for a field to be really mutable, it must be\nmarked as such, and be a field of a mutable value.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n| mut y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut p1 = Point (1, 2);\n    p1.y = 98; // y is mutable\n                  // and p1 is mutable no problem\n\n    p1.x = 34; // x is not mutable, this won't compile\n\n    let p2 = Point (1, 2);\n    p2.y = 98; // p2 is not mutable, this won't compile    \n}\n\nErrors:\nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(13,4)\n13  ┃     p1.x = 34; // x is not mutable, this won't compile\n    ╋       ^\n\nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(16,4)\n16  ┃     p2.y = 98; // p2 is not mutable, this won't compile    \n    ╋       ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.4. Memory borrowing of structure\nBy default structure data are located in the value that contains them,\ni.e. in the stack inside a variable, on the heap inside a slice,\netc. They are copied by value, at assignement or function call. This\ncopy is static, and does not require allocation, so it is allowed\nimplicitely. \nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| mut x : i32\n| mut y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let p = Point (1, 2);\n    let mut p2 = p; // make a copy of the structure\n    p2.y = 12;\n\n    assert (p.y == 2);\n    assert (p2.y == 12);\n}\n\n\nStructure may contain aliasable values, such as slice. In that case,\nthe copy is no longer allowed implicitely (if the structure is\nmutable, and the field containing the aliasable value is also\nmutable, and the element that will borrow the data is also\nmutable). To resolve the problem, the keywords dcopy, and alias\npresented in Aliases and\nReferences\ncan be used.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| mut y : [mut [mut i32]]\n -> Point;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    let mut a = Point ([[1, 23, 3], [4, 5, 6]]);\n    let mut b = dcopy a;\n    let mut c = alias a;\n\n    b.y [0][0] = 9; // only change the value of 'b'\n    c.y [0][1] = 2; // change the value of 'a' and 'c'\n\n    println (a);\n    println (b);\n    println (c);\n}\n\n\nResults:\nmain::Point([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nmain::Point([[9, 23, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nmain::Point([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n\nIt is impossible to make a simple copy of a structure with the keyword\ncopy, the mutability level being set once and for all in the\nstructure definition. For example, if a structure S contains a field\nwhose type is mut [mut [i32]], every value of type S have a\nfield of type mut [mut [i32]]. For that reason, by making a\nfirst level copy, the mutability level would not be respected.\n1.5. Packed and Union\nThis part only concerns advanced programming paradigms, and is close\nto the machine level. It is unlikely that you will ever need it,\nunless you try to optimize your code at a binary level.\n1.5.1. Packed\nThe size of a structure is calculated by the compiler, which decides\nthe alignment of the different fields. This is why the size of a\nstructure containing an i64 and a c8 is 16 bytes, not 9\nbytes. There is no guarantee about the size or the order of the fields\nin the generated program. To force the compiler to remove the\noptimized alignment, the special modifier packed can be\nused. \nimport std::io\n\nstruct @packed\n| x : i64\n| c : c8\n -> Packed;\n\nstruct \n| x : i64\n| c : c8\n -> Unpacked;\n\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Size of packed : \", sizeof Packed);\n    println (\"Size of unpacked : \", sizeof Unpacked);\n}\n\nResults: \nSize of packed : 9\nSize of unpacked : 16\n1.5.2. Union\nThe union special modifier , on the other hand, informs the\ncompiler that all fields in the structure must share the same memory\nlocation. In the following example, the union modifier is used\non a structure containing two fields. The largest field of the\nstructure is the field y of type f64. The size of this\nfield is 8 bytes, thus the structure has a size of 8 bytes as\nwell. All the fields are aligned at the beginning of the strucures,\nmeaning that the field x, and y shares the same address in\nmemory.\nstruct @union \n| x : i32\n| y : f64\n -> Dummy;\n\n\nThe construction of a structure with union modifier requires\nonly one argument. This argument must be passed as a named\nexpression with the arrow operator ->.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct @union\n| x : i32\n| y : f32\n -> Dummy;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let x = Dummy (y-> 12.0f);\n\n    // Comparison of pointer is only possible on pointer of the same type\n    // Any pointer can be casted into a pointer of &void (the contrary is not possible)\n    // is operator, checks if two pointer are equals\n    assert (cast!(&void) (&(x.x)) is cast!(&void) (&(x.y)));\n\n    // The value of x depends on the value of y\n    assert (x.x == 1094713344);\n    assert (x.y == 12.0f);\n}\n\n1.6. Structure specific attributes\nStructures have type specific attributes, as any types, accessible with\nthe double colon binary operator ::. The table below presents\nthese specific attributes. These attributes are accessible using a\ntype of struct, and not a value. A example, under the table presents\nusage of struct specific attributes.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value of the type\n\n\ntypeid\nThe name of the type stored in a value of type [c32]\n\n\ntypeinfo\nA structure of type TypeInfo, containing information about the type\n\n\n\nAll the information about TypeInfo are presented in chapter Dynamic types.\nmod main;\n\nimport std::io;\n\nstruct\n| x : i32\n| y : i32 = 9\n -> Point; \n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let x = Point::init;\n\n    // the structure is declared in the main module, thus its name is main::Point    \n    assert (Point::typeid == \"main::Point\");\n\n    assert (x.x == i32::init && x.y == 9);\n}\n\n"},"types/enum.html":{"url":"types/enum.html","title":"Enum","keywords":"","body":"1. Enumeration1.1. Value access1.1.1. Value types1.1.2. Value constructions1.1.3. Value context1.2. Enumeration specific attributes1. Enumeration\nEnumerations are user-defined types that enumerates a list of\nvalues. The keyword enum is used to define an enumeration type. The\ntype of the fields can be inferred from the value associated to the\nfields. This type can be forced using the type operator :, after\nthe keyword enum. All the fields of an enumeration shares the\nsame type.\nThe complete grammar of an enumeration is presented in the following\nsource block. As for struct declaration, templates can be used, but\nthis functionnality will only be discussed in the\nTemplates\nchapter.\nenum_type := 'enum' (':' type)? (inner_value)+ '->' identifier (templates)?;\ninner_value := '|' identifier '=' expression\nidentifier := ('_')* [A-z] ([A-z0-9_])*\n\n\nIn the following source code, an example of an enumeration of type\n[c32] is presented. This enumeration lists the names of the\ndays.\nimport std::io\n\nenum\n| MONDAY = \"Mon\"\n| TUESDAY = \"Tue\"\n| WEDNESDAY = \"Wed\"\n| THURSDAY = \"Thu\"\n| FRIDAY = \"Fri\"\n| SATURDAY = \"Sat\"\n| SUNDAY = \"Sun\"\n -> Day;\n\ndef foo (day : Day) {\n    println (day);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let d = Day::MONDAY;\n    foo (d);\n}\n\n1.1. Value access\nThe values of an enumeration are accessible using the double colon\nbinary operator ::. In practice, access a value of the\nenumeration will past the content value of the field at the caller\nlocation. The value - result of the expression - is of the type of the\nenumeration (for example the type Day in the example below).\n1.1.1. Value types\nAn example of enumeration access is presented in the following source\ncode. In this example, implicit casting is perform from a Day to\na [c32], when calling the function foo, at line\n23. This implicit cast is allowed.\nimport std::io\n\nenum : [c32] // the type is optional\n| MONDAY = \"Mon\"\n| TUESDAY = \"Tue\"\n| WEDNESDAY = \"Wed\"\n| THURSDAY = \"Thu\"\n| FRIDAY = \"Fri\"\n| SATURDAY = \"Sat\"\n| SUNDAY = \"Sun\"\n -> Day;\n\ndef foo (day : [c32]) {\n    println (day);\n}\n\ndef bar (day : Day) {\n    println (day);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    // the internal type Day is of type [c32], so it can be implicitely casted into [c32]\n    foo (Day::MONDAY);\n\n    bar (Day::MONDAY);\n\n    // However, it is impossible to transform a [c32] into a Day implicitely\n    bar (\"Mon\")\n}\n\n\nHowever, the contrary is not allowed, because the source code tries to\ncast a [c32] into a Day at line 28, the compiler\nreturns an error. The error is presented in the code block below. Such\ncast is forbidden, to avoid enumeration value to contain a value that\nis actually not defined in the list of the field of the\nenumeration. For example, if this was accepted, the string\n\"NotADay\" would be castable into a Day (note: the value\nof the string being possibly unknown at compilation time).\nError : the call operator is not defined for main::bar and {mut [c32]}\n --> main.yr:(28,9)\n28  ┃     bar (\"Mon\")\n    ╋         ^     ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate bar --> main.yr:(17,5) : main::bar (day : main::Day([c32]))-> void\n    ┃     ┃ Error : incompatible types main::Day and mut [c32]\n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(28,10)\n    ┃     ┃ 28  ┃     bar (\"Mon\")\n    ┃     ┃     ╋          ^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : for parameter day --> main.yr:(17,10) of main::bar (day : main::Day([c32]))-> void\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n1.1.2. Value constructions\nEnumeration values can be more complex than literals. Any kind of\nvalue can be used, for example call functions, condition block, scope\nguards, etc. In the following example, an enumeration creating\nstructure from function call is presented. The type of the enumeration\nis Ipv4Addr.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct\n| a : i32\n| b : i32\n| c : i32\n| d : i32\n -> Ipv4Addr;\n\nenum\n| LOCALHOST = localhost ()\n| BROADCAST = broadcast ()\n -> KnownAddr;\n\ndef localhost ()-> Ipv4Addr {\n    println (\"Call localhost\");\n    Ipv4Addr (127, 0, 0, 1)\n}\n\ndef broadcast ()-> Ipv4Addr {\n    println (\"Call broadcast\");    \n    Ipv4Addr (255, 255, 255, 255)\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let addr = KnownAddr::LOCALHOST; // will call localhost here\n\n    assert (KnownAddr::LOCALHOST.a == 127); // a second time here\n    assert (KnownAddr::BROADCAST.d == 255); // call broadcast here\n    assert (addr.a == 127);\n}\n\n\nThe enumeration value of a field is constructed at each access, this\nmeans for example that when enumeration values are constructed using\nfunction call, the function is called each time the enumeration field\nis accessed. Thus the result of the execution of the compiled source\ncode above is the following:\nCall localhost\nCall localhost\nCall broadcast\n\n1.1.3. Value context\nIf the value of the enumeration seems to be passed at the caller\nlocation, they don't share the context of the caller. In other words,\nthe fields of an enumeration have access to the symbol accessible from\nthe enumeration context, and not from the caller context. An example,\nof enumeration trying to access symbols is presented in the source\ncode bellow.\nimport std::io\n\nstatic __GLOB__ = true;\n\nenum \n| FOO = (if (x) { 42 } else { 11 })\n| BAR = (if (__GLOB__) { 42 } else { 11 })\n -> ErrorEnum;\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = false;\n\n    println (ErrorEnum::FOO); \n}\n\n \nFrom the above example, the compiler returns an error. In this error,\nthe compiler informs that the variable x is not defined from the\ncontext of the enumeration. Even if the variable is declared inside\nthe main function, it is not accessible from the enumeration\ncontext. The global variable __GLOB__ is accessible from the\nenumeration context, and thus accessing it is not an issue.\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(6,3)\n 6  ┃ | FOO = (if (x) { 42 } else { 11 })\n    ╋   ^^^\n    ┃ Error : undefined symbol x\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(6,14)\n    ┃  6  ┃ | FOO = (if (x) { 42 } else { 11 })\n    ┃     ╋              ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(13,11)\n13  ┃     println (ErrorEnum::FOO); \n    ╋              ^^^^^^^^^\n    ┃ Error : the type main::ErrorEnum is not complete due to previous errors\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(8,5)\n    ┃  8  ┃  -> ErrorEnum;\n    ┃     ╋     ^^^^^^^^^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : \n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(13,11)\n    ┃     ┃ 13  ┃     println (ErrorEnum::FOO); \n    ┃     ┃     ╋              ^^^^^^^^^\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.2.

To avoid conflict, the priority is given to the\nfields of the enumeration, and specific attributes can be accessed\nusing their identifier surrounded by _ tokens. For example,\naccessing the members specific attributes can be made using the\nidentifier __members__. An example of the principle is presented in\nthe following source code.

Objects\nYmir is a object oriented language, with polymorph types. In this\nchapter, we assume that you are familiar with object oriented\nprogramming paradigm (if not, you will benefit from reading\ninformation on that paradigm first cf.  object oriented\nprogramming.).\nIn Ymir, object instances are dynamically allocated on the\nheap. Indeed, because object types are polymorph, their size cannot be\nknown at compile time, and consequently cannot be placed in the\nstack. To illustrate this point, the following figure presents the UML\ndefinition of a class A, and an heir class B. The class\nA contains a field x, of type i32, thus of size\n4 bytes. The class B, contains another field y of size\n4, leading to a class B of size 8.\n\n\n\nBecause we want to following source code to be accepted (basic\nprinciple of polymorphism), the size of A, cannot be statically\nset to 4 bytes, (nor to 8, the class B can come from a\ntotally different part of the source code - from a library for example\n-, and unknown when using the type A, without talking of the\nhuge loss of memory if only A values are used).\ndef foo (a : &(A)) // ...    \n\ndef main () {\n    let b : &B = // ...\n    foo (b); // calling foo with a B, heir of A\n}\n\n\nFor that reason, object instances are aliasable types, and only\ncontains a pointer to the values of the class. You may have notice the\nsyntax &(A), in the above example. If this syntax is similar to\npointer, this is because objects are basically pointers. However,\nunlike basic pointers, these cannot be used in pointer arithmetics,\ncannot be null, and does not need to be dereferenced to access\nthe value. In other words, these are reference, more than pointers.\nYes, unlike other object oriented language such as java or D,\nobject instances cannot be null. This is a really important part\nof the object system in Ymir guaranteeing that every objects are\npointing to a valid value, and that value is correctly initialized\n(constructor was called).\nWe will see in the coming chapters, that removing the possibility of\nnull objects does not remove any capacity on the language, while\nadding strong safety, the number one error of java programs\nbeing NullPointerException (cf.

'{' class_content '}'\nclass_content :=   field\n                 | method\n                 | constructor\n                 | impl\n                 | destructor\nmodifiers := '@' ('{' modifier (',' modifier)* '}') | (modifier)\nmodifier := 'final' | 'abstract'\n\n\nAs many symbols, the class can be a template symbols. Templates are\nnot presented in this chapter, and are left for a future chapter\n(cf.\nTemplates).\n1.1. Fields\nA class can contain fields. A field is declared as a variable, using\nthe keyword let. A field can have a default value, in that case the\ntype is optional, however if the value is not set, the field must have\na type. Multiple fields can be declared within the same let,\nwith coma separating them.\nclass Point4D {\n    let _x : i32;\n    let _y = 0;\n    let _z : i32, _w = 0;\n}\n\n1.1.1. Field privacy\nAll fields are protected by default, i.e. only the class defining them\nand its heirs have access to them. The keyword pub can be used\nto make the fields public, and accessible from outside the class\ndefinition. The keyword prv, on the other hand, can be use to\nmake the field totally hidden from outside the class. Unlike\nprot, prv fields are not accessible by the heirs of a\nclass.\nA good practice is to enclose the privacy of the fields in their name\ndefinition. For example, a public field is named x, without any\n_ token. A protected fields always starts with a single\nunderscore, _y, and private fields are surrounded by two\nunderscores before and after the identifier. This is just a convention,\nthe name has no impact on the privacy.\nclass A {\n    pub  let x = 12;\n    prot let _y : i32;\n    prv  let __z__ : i32;\n}\n\n1.2. Constructor\nTo be instancible, a class must declare at least one constructor. The\nconstructor is always named self, and takes parameters to build the\nobject. The object is accessible within the constructor body through\nthe variable self.\n1.2.1. Field construction\nThe constructor must set the value to all the fields of the\nclass, with the keyword with. Fields with default values are not\nnecessarily set by this with statement, but can be\nredefined. The with statement has the effect of the initial value of\nthe fields, meaning that the value of immutable fields is set by them.\nclass Point {\n    let _x : i32;\n    let _y = 0;\n\n    /**\n     * _y is already initialized\n     * it is not mandatory to add it in the with initialization\n     */\n    pub self () with _x = 12 {}\n\n    /**\n     * But it can be redefined\n     */\n    pub self (x : i32, y : i32) with _x = x, _y = y {}\n}\n\n \nField value is set only once. For example, if a class has a field\n_x with a default value, calling a function foo. And the\nconstructor use the with statement to set the value of the field\nfrom the return value of the bar function, the function\nfoo is never called.\ndef foo () -> i32 {\n    println (\"Foo\");\n    42\n}\n\ndef bar () -> i32 {\n    println (\"bar\")\n    33\n}\n\nclass A {\n    let _x = foo ();\n\n    pub self () with _x = bar () {} // foo is not called, bar is call instead\n}\n\n\nThe point behind with field construction, is to ensure that all\nfields have a value, when entering the constructor body. This way,\nwhen instruction are made inside the constructor body, such as\nprinting the value of the fields, their value is already set, and the\nobject instance is already valid.\nclass A {\n    let _x : i32;\n\n    pub self () with _x = 42 {\n        println (self._x); // access the field _x, of the current object instance\n    } \n}\n\n1.2.2. Create an object instance\nClass are used to create object instance, by calling a\nconstructor. This call is made using the double colon binary operator\n::, with the left operand being the name of the class to\ninstantiate, and the right operand the keyword new. After the\nkeyword new a list of argument is presented, this list is the\nlist of argument to pass to the constructor. The constructor with the\nbest affinity is choosed and called on a allocated instance of the\nclass. Constructor affinity is computed as function affinity (based on\ntype mutability, and type compatibility – cf. Aliases and\nReferences).\nimport std::io\n\nclass A {\n\n    pub self (x : i32) {\n        println (\"Int : \", x);\n    }\n\n    pub self (x : f32) {\n        println (\"Float : \", x);\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let _ = A::new (12);\n    let _ = A::new (12.f);\n}\n\n\nResults\nInt : 12\nFloat : 12.000000\n1.2.3. Named constructor\nA name can be added to the constructor. This name is an Identifier,\nand follows the keyword self. A named constructor can be called\nby its name when constructing a class. This way two constructor can\nshare the same prototype, and be called from their name. A named\nconstructor is not ignored when constructing a class with the\nnew keyword, its named is just not considered.\nIn the following example, a class A contains two constructors,\nfoo and bar, these constructors have one parameter of type\ni32. \nimport std::io\n\nclass A {\n    let _x : i32;\n\n    pub self foo (x : i32) with _x = x {\n        println (\"Foo \", self._x);\n    }\n\n    pub self bar (x : i32) with _x = x {\n        println (\"Bar \", self._x);\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let _ = A::foo (12);\n    let _ = A::bar (12); \n\n    let _ = A::new (12);\n}\n\n\nThe last object construction at line 19 is not possible, the call\nworking with both foo and bar. The other constructions\nwork fine, that is why the compiler returns only the following error.\nError : {self foo (x : i32)-> mut &(mut main::A), self bar (x : i32)-> mut &(mut main::A)} x 2 called with {i32} work with both\n --> main.yr:(19,17)\n19  ┃     let _ = A::new (12);\n    ╋                    ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate self --> main.yr:(6,6) : self foo (x : i32)-> mut &(mut main::A)\n    ┃ Note : candidate self --> main.yr:(10,6) : self bar (x : i32)-> mut &(mut main::A)\n    ┗━━━━━━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.2.4. Construction redirection\nTo avoid redondent code, a constructor can call another constructor in\nthe with statement. This call redirection is performed by using\nthe self keyword. In that case, because the fields are already\nconstructed by the called constructor, they must not be reconstructed.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass A {\n    let _x : i32;\n\n    pub self () with self (12) {\n        println (\"Scd \", self._x);\n    }\n\n    pub self (x : i32) with _x = x {\n        println (\"Fst \", self._x);\n    }\n\n}\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let _ = A::new (); // construct an instance of the class A\n                       // from the constructor at line 6\n}\n\n\nResults:\nFst 12\nScd 12\n\nContribution: Redirection to named constructor does not work for the moment. This is not complicated, but has to be done.\n1.2.5. Constructor privacy\nAs fields, the privacy of the constructor is protected by default. The\nkeyword prv and pub can be used to change it.\n1.3. Destructors\nObject instances are destroyed by the garbage collector. Meaning that\nthere is no way to determine when or even if an object instance will\nbe destroyed. But lets say that such operation effectively happen\n(which is quite probable, let's no lie either), then a last function\ncan be called just before the object instance is destroyed and\nirrecoverable. The destructor is called __dtor, and takes the\nparameter mut self. There is only one destructor per class, this\ndestructor is optional and always public.\nimport std::io;\n\nstatic mut I = 0;\n\nclass A {\n    let _x : i32;\n    pub self () with _x = I {\n        I += 1;\n    }\n\n    __dtor (mut self) {\n        println (\"Destroying me ! \", self._x); \n    }\n\n}\n\ndef foo () {\n    let _ = A::new (); \n} // the object instance is irrecoverable at the end of the function\n\ndef main () {\n    loop {\n        foo ();\n    }\n}\n\n\nResults:\nDestroying me ! 765\nDestroying me ! 1022\nDestroying me ! 764\nDestroying me ! 1023\nDestroying me ! 763\nDestroying me ! 1024\nDestroying me ! 762\nDestroying me ! 1025\nDestroying me ! 761\nDestroying me ! 1026\n...\n\nOne can note from the result, that the order of destruction is totally\nunpredictible. Rely on class destructor is not the best practice. We\nwill see in a future chapter disposable objects, that are destroyed in\na more certain way. Destructors are a last resort to free unmanaged\nmemory, if this was forgotten (for example, file handles, network\nsocket, etc. if not manually disposed).\n"},"objects/mutability.html":{"url":"objects/mutability.html","title":"Mutability","keywords":"","body":"1.

This is a conceptual choice, whose purpose is\nto improve code readability and sharing, by avoiding useless and\npreventable search for the source of the variables.\n1.1. Privacy\nMethods are protected by default. Meaning that only the class that\nhave defined them, and its heir class have acces to them. The keyword\npub and prv can be used to change the privacy of a\nmethod. A public method is accessible everywhere, using an object\ninstance, and private methods are only accessible by the class that\nhave defined them. Unlike protected methods, private methods are not\naccessible by heir classes. Privacy of methods is the same as privacy\nof fields.\nimport std::io\n\nclass A {\n\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def foo (self) {\n        println (\"Foo\");\n        self.bar ();\n    }\n\n    prv def bar (self) {\n        println (\"bar\");\n    }\n}\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new ();\n    a.foo ();\n    a.bar ();\n}\n\n\nBecause the method bar is private in the context of the\nmain function, the compiler returns the following error.

To illustrate this point, the following\nexample presents a base class Foo with a constructor printing\nfoo, and a heir class Bar, calling the function bar*\n(printing the value bar) to initialize its field _x.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef bar () -> i32 {\n    println( \"Bar\");\n    42\n}\n\nclass Foo {    \n    pub self () {\n        println (\"Foo\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    let _x : i32;\n\n    pub self () with _x = bar () {}\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let _ = Bar::new ();\n}\n\n\nResults: \nFoo\nBar\n \nHowever, because constructor redirection does not call parent\nconstructor, and let that work to the called constructor, to which\nthey are redirected, the following program has a different\nbehavior. The arguments of the redirection are computed first, then\nthe call to the parent constructor, and finally the construction of\nthe fields of the heir class.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef bar () -> i32 {\n    println( \"Bar\");\n    29\n}\n\ndef baz () -> i32 {\n    println( \"Baz\");\n    13\n}\n\nclass Foo {\n    pub self () {\n        println (\"Foo\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    let _x : i32;\n\n    /**\n     * Call parent constructor at line 14, and then bar\n     */\n    pub self (x : i32) with _x = bar () + x {}\n\n    /**\n     * Call baz first, then self at line 25\n     */\n    pub self () with self (baz ()) {} \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let _ = Bar::new ();\n}\n\n\nResults:\nBaz\nFoo\nBar\n\n The construction order is perfectly predictible, but should not\nhave an impact on the program behavior. So it is probably not a good\nidea to rely on it.\n1.3. Parent class destruction\nIn contrast to construction, the parent destructor is the last\noperation of the destruction of a heir class. The parent destructor is\nalways called, there is no way to avoid it (aside exiting the\nprogram). \nimport std::io;\n\nclass Foo {    \n    pub self () {}\n    __dtor (mut self) {\n        println (\"Destroying Foo\");\n        println (\"====\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    __dtor (mut self) {\n        println (\"====\");\n        println (\"Destroying Bar\");\n        return {} // desperately trying to avoid parent destruction\n    }\n}\n\ndef foo () {\n    let _ = Bar::new ();\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    loop {\n        foo ();\n    }\n}\n\n\nResults:\n====\nDestroying Bar\nDestroying Foo\n====\n====\nDestroying Bar\nDestroying Foo\n====\n====\nDestroying Bar\nDestroying Foo\n====\n...\n1.4. Method overriding\nThe keyword over is used to override a method. Methods cannot be\n implicitly overriden by omitting the over keyword and using the\n def keyword. The signature of the method must be strictly identical\n to the one of the ancestor method, including privacy, and argument\n mutability. Of course, private methods cannot be overriden, because\n hidden to heir classes, but protected and public methods can be\n overriden. In the following example, a class Shape define the\n method area. This method is public, and then can be overriden\n by heir classes. The class Circle and Rectangle overrides\n the methods.\nimport std::io\n\nclass Shape {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def area (self) -> f64 \n    0.0\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    let _radius : f64;\n    pub self (radius : f64) with _radius = radius {}\n\n    pub over area (self) -> f64 {\n        import std::math;\n        math::PI * (self._radius * self._radius)\n    }\n}\n\nclass Square over Shape {\n    let _side : f64;\n    pub self (side : f64) with _side = side {}\n\n    pub over area (self) -> f64 {\n        self._side * self._side\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut s : &Shape = Circle::new (12.0);\n    println (s.area ());\n\n    s = Square::new (3.0);\n    println (s.area ());    \n}\n\n\nResults:\n452.389342\n9.000000\n1.4.1. Override mutable method\nThe mutability of the method must be respected in the heir class. This\nmeans that mutable method must be mutable in the heir, and immutable\nmethods must be immutable in the heir.\nclass Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def foo (mut self)-> void {}\n\n    pub def bar (self)-> void {}\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub over foo (self)-> void {}\n\n    pub over bar (mut self)-> void {}\n}\n\n\nErrors:\nError : when validating main::Bar\n --> main.yr:(9,7)\n 9  ┃ class Bar over Foo {\n    ╋       ^^^\n    ┃ Error : the method (const self) => main::Bar::foo ()-> void marked as override does not override anything\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(12,11)\n    ┃ 12  ┃     pub over foo (self)-> void {}\n    ┃     ╋              ^^^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : candidate foo --> main.yr:(4,10) : (mut self) => main::Foo::foo ()-> void\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━━ \n    ┃ Error : the method (mut self) => main::Bar::bar ()-> void marked as override does not override anything\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(14,11)\n    ┃ 14  ┃     pub over bar (mut self)-> void {}\n    ┃     ╋              ^^^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : candidate bar --> main.yr:(6,10) : (const self) => main::Foo::bar ()-> void\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.4.2. Final methods\nA base class can flag its method to avoid overriding. This flag is\nplaced as a custom modifier before the name of the method.\nclass Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def @final foo (self) {}\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub over foo (self) {}\n}\n\n\nErrors:\nError : when validating main::Bar\n --> main.yr:(7,7)\n 7  ┃ class Bar over Foo {\n    ╋       ^^^\n    ┃ Error : cannot override final method (const self) => main::Foo::foo ()-> void\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(10,14)\n    ┃ 10  ┃     pub over foo (self) {}\n    ┃     ╋              ^^^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : \n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(4,20)\n    ┃     ┃  4  ┃     pub def @final foo (self) {}\n    ┃     ┃     ╋                    ^^^\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n \nThis flag can also be used on an overriden method inside a heir\nclass to avoid further overriding. \nclass Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def foo (self) {}\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub over @final foo (self) {}\n}\n\nclass Baz over Bar {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub over foo (self) {}\n}\n\n\nErrors:\nError : when validating main::Baz\n --> main.yr:(13,7)\n13  ┃ class Baz over Bar {\n    ╋       ^^^\n    ┃ Error : cannot override final method (const self) => main::Bar::foo ()-> void\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(16,14)\n    ┃ 16  ┃     pub over foo (self) {}\n    ┃     ╋              ^^^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : \n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(10,21)\n    ┃     ┃ 10  ┃     pub over @final foo (self) {}\n    ┃     ┃     ╋                     ^^^\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.5. Abstract class\nA class can be abstract, this means that the class cannot be\ninstantiated even if it has a constructor. An abstract class can\ndeclare methods without body, these methods must be overriden by heir\nclasses. An abstract must have a constructor to be heritable, this\nconstructor being called by the heir classes. Not that an abstract\nclass can have no public constructors, but that a class that have no\npublic constructors is not necessarily abstract.\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    prot self () {} // need a constructor to be inheritable\n\n    pub def area (self)-> f64; // Method does not need a body\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    let _radius : f64;\n    pub self (radius : f64) with _radius = radius {}\n\n    pub over area (self) -> f64 {\n        import std::math;\n        math::PI * (self._radius * self._radius)\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let s : Shape = Circle::new (12);\n    println (s.area ());\n}\n\n1.5.1. Method with no body\nA method of an abstract class can have a body, and thus behave as any\nmethod of any class. It can also have no body, but in that case heir\nclass must override this method. Otherwise the class is\nincomplete. Abstract class can be heir class, in that case they don't\nneed to override the methods without body.\nclass @abstract Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def foo (self);\n}\n\nclass @abstract Bar over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\nclass Baz over Bar {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\n\nError:\nError : when validating main::Baz\n --> main.yr:(11,7)\n11  ┃ class Baz over Bar {\n    ╋       ^^^\n    ┃ Error : the class main::Baz is not abstract, but does not override the empty parent method (const self) => main::Foo::foo ()-> void\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(11,7)\n    ┃ 11  ┃ class Baz over Bar {\n    ┃     ╋       ^^^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : \n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(4,13)\n    ┃     ┃  4  ┃     pub def foo (self);\n    ┃     ┃     ╋             ^^^\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.6. Final class\nFinal classes declared with the custom attributes @final defines\nclasses that cannot have heirs. A final class, can be an heir class,\nor a base class. If the class is a base class, strong optimization can\nbe made by the compiler, (no vtable required, and call of the methods\nare direct and way faster). For that reason, it is a good practice to\nflag classes for which we are certain they cannot be inheritable. This\noptimization is also done on final methods (if they are not overriden,\ni.e. final when define for the first time), thus this is a good\npractice to flag methods for which we are certain they won't be\noverriden. This optimization cannot be done if the class is not a base\nclass.\nclass @final Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def foo (self) {}\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\n\nError:\nError : the base class main::Foo is marked as final\n --> main.yr:(7,16)\n 7  ┃ class Bar over Foo {\n    ╋                ^^^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nContribution: It is possible to have an abstract and final class. I\ndidn't find any use case for that, maybe that is completely useless,\nand must be prohibited.\n1.7. Casting base class objects to heir class\nIn many languages (such as C++, D, Java, or Scala) polymorphism gives\nthe possibility to cast an object of a base class into an object of an\nheir class. This is not possible in Ymir because this behavior is\nnot safe. We will see in the chapter Pattern\nmatching how\nto achieve a cast of an object into a heir class, in a safe way. \nHowever, the std provides a safe shortcut that can be used to\nachieve the cast. This shortcut is by using the template function\nto of the module std::conv. This function throws a\nCastFailure exception when the cast failed, (safe in Ymir\nmeans that the error can be managed, and has to be managed in fact, as\nwe will see in the chapter on Error\nhandling). In\nthe following example, two objects are stored in the variable x\nand y, whose type are &Foo. The first cast at line 18\nworks, because the variable x indeed contains an object of type\n&Bar, however the cast at line 19 does not work, the\nvariable y stores an object of type &Foo.\nimport std::conv;\n\nclass Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &CastFailure // the possible errors are rethrown, so the program ends if there is an error \n{\n    let x : &Foo = Bar::new ();\n    let y : &Foo = Foo::new ();\n\n    let _ : &Bar = x.to!(&Bar) (); // possibly throw a &CastFailure\n    let _ : &Bar = y.to!(&Bar) (); // here as well, (and actually throw it)\n}\n\n \nThe following result happens because an error is thrown by the main\nfunction, and then unmanaged by the program. The stacktrace is printed\nbecause the program was compiled in debug mode. We can see in this\ntrace (at line 11) that the error was effectively thrown by the\nconversion at line 19. \nUnhandled exception\nException in file \"/home/emile/gcc/gcc-install/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.3.0/include/ymir/std/conv.yr\", at line 820, in function \"std::conv::to(&(main::Bar),&(main::Foo))::to\", of type std::conv::CastFailure.\n╭  Stack trace :\n╞═ bt ╕ #1\n│     ╘═> /lib/libgyruntime.so:??\n╞═ bt ╕ #2\n│     ╘═> /lib/libgyruntime.so:??\n╞═ bt ╕ #3 in function std::conv::toNP94main3BarNP94main3Foo::to (...)\n│     ╘═> /home/emile/gcc/gcc-install/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.3.0/include/ymir/std/conv.yr:820\n╞═ bt ╕ #4 in function main (...)\n│     ╘═> /home/emile/Documents/test/ymir/main.yr:19\n╞═ bt ╕ #5\n│     ╘═> /lib/libgyruntime.so:??\n╞═ bt ╕ #6 in function main\n│     ╘═> /home/emile/Documents/test/ymir/main.yr:12\n╞═ bt ╕ #7\n│     ╘═> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6:??\n╞═ bt ═ #8 in function _start\n╰\nAborted (core dumped)\n"},"objects/traits.html":{"url":"objects/traits.html","title":"Traits","keywords":"","body":"1. Trait1.1. Inherit a Class implementing a Trait1.1.1. Simple reimplementation1.1.2. Override implemented method1.2. Trait privacy1.3. Trait usage1. Trait\nTraits are used to define as their name suggest traits that can be\nimplemented by a class. To define them, the keyword trait is\nused. A trait is not a type, and can only be implemented by class,\nfor that reason, a variable or a value cannot be of a trait type.\nAn example of a trait, is presented in the following source block. The\nidea of this trait, is to ensure that every class, implementing it,\nhave a public method named print that can be called without\nparameters.\ntrait Printable {\n    pub def print (self);    \n}\n\n\nWhen a class implements a trait, all the method declared in the trait\nare added in the definition of the class. If the class is not abstract\nall the method of the traits must have a body. For example, if a non\nabstract class implement the trait Printable, thus it must\noverride the method print to add a body to it.\nimport std::io\n\nclass Point {\n    // ... Constructors and attributes\n\n    impl Printable {\n        // Try to remove the following definition\n        pub over print (self) {\n            print (\"Point {\", self._x, \", \", self._y, \"}\");\n        }\n    }    \n}\n\n\nA trait can provide a default behavior for the method it defines. The\nbody of the method is validated for each implementation. In the\nfollowing example, the method print defined in the trait\nPrintable, prints the typeid of the class that implement the\ntraits. One can note, that the behavior of this function is different\nfor each class that implements it, that is why it is only validated\nwhen a class implement the trait.\nmod main; \n\ntrait Printable {\n    pub def print (self) {\n        import std::io;\n        print (typeof (self)::typeid);\n        // Here we don't know the type yet\n    }\n}\n\nclass Point {\n    // ... Constructors and attributes\n\n    impl Printable;  // 'print' method prints (\"main::Point\")\n}\n\nclass Line {\n    // ... Constructors and attributes\n\n    impl Printable;  // 'print' method prints (\"main::Line\")\n}\n\n\nWarning: If a trait is never implemented by any class, and have\nmethods with default behavior, then it is never validated. Thus errors\ncan be present in this trait, but still pass the compilation. One can\nsee the trait as a kind of template, this problem being present in\ntemplate symbol as well (cf.\nTemplates).\n1.1. Inherit a Class implementing a Trait\nThe methods of a trait can be overriden by heir classes. In order to\ndo this, heir classes must reimplement the trait, and override the\nmethods. \n1.1.1. Simple reimplementation\nIn the following example, the class Shape implements\nthe trait Printable, this trait has a method print with a\ndefault behavior. The class Circle does not reimplement the\ntrait, thus when calling the method print of a Circle value, the\nvalue main::Shape is printed on the stdout. On the other hand,\nthe class Rectange reimplement the traits, thus the value\nmain::Rectangle is printed.\nmod main;\n\ntrait Printable {\n    pub def print (self) {\n        import std::io;\n        println (typeof (self)::typeid);\n    }\n}\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n\n    impl Printable;\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\nclass Rectangle over Shape {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    impl Printable; // reimplement the method print with typeof (self) being main::Rectangle\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let c = Circle::new ();\n    c.print ();\n\n    let r = Rectangle::new ();\n    r.print ();\n}\n\n\nResults: \nmain::Shape\nmain::Rectangle\n1.1.2. Override implemented method\nImplemented method cannot be overriden without reimplementing the\ntrait. In the following example, a class Shape implement the\ntrait Printable, and the class Circle inherits\nShape, and tries to override the method print. \nmod main;\nimport std::io;\n\ntrait Printable {\n    pub def print (self);\n}\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n\n    impl Printable {\n        pub over print (self) {\n            println (\"main::Shape\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub over print (self) {}\n}\n\n\nErrors: \nError : when validating main::Circle\n --> main.yr:(18,7)\n18  ┃ class Circle over Shape {\n    ╋       ^^^^^^\n    ┃ Error : cannot override the trait method (const self) => main::Shape::print ()-> void outside the implementation of the trait\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(21,14)\n    ┃ 21  ┃     pub over print (self) {}\n    ┃     ╋              ^^^^^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : \n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(12,18)\n    ┃     ┃ 12  ┃         pub over print (self) {\n    ┃     ┃     ╋                  ^^^^^\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nTo prevent the previous error, the class Circle have to\nreimplement the trait Printable. When reimplementing a trait in\na heir class, the parent overriding is not taken into account, and the\nmethod of the trait is used. In the following example, the class\nShape implement the trait Printable, that have a method\nprint with no default behavior. The class Circle tries to\nreimplement the trait, but without overriding the print\nmethod. This source code is rejected by the compiler, the class\nCircle is not abstract, but has a method with no body.\nmod main;\nimport std::io;\n\ntrait Printable {\n    pub def print (self);\n}\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n\n    impl Printable {\n        pub over print (self) {\n            println (\"main::Shape\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    impl Printable;\n}\n\n\nErrors: \nError : when validating main::Circle\n --> main.yr:(18,7)\n18  ┃ class Circle over Shape {\n    ╋       ^^^^^^\n    ┃ Error : the class main::Circle is not abstract, but does not override the empty parent method (const self) => main::Printable::print ()-> void\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(18,7)\n    ┃ 18  ┃ class Circle over Shape {\n    ┃     ╋       ^^^^^^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : \n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(5,10)\n    ┃     ┃  5  ┃     pub def print (self);\n    ┃     ┃     ╋             ^^^^^\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nTo resolve that problem, the class Circle must add a body to the\nmethod print. It can happen that a trait defines multiple\nmethods, and that only some have to be reimplemented by the heir\nclass. In that case, there is no magical solution, maybe a\ncontribution can enhance that, but every methods must be\nreimplemented. In order to mimic the behavior of the parent\nimplementation, the super keyword can be used.\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    pub self () {}    \n\n    impl Printable {\n\n        pub over print (self)-> void { \n            self::super.print (); // call the print method of the super class         \n        }\n    }    \n}\n\n\n1.2. Trait privacy\nTrait implementation is always public. For that reason, privacy\nspecifier (pub, prot and prv) have no meaning on\nimplementation. \nOn the other hand, the trait methods implementation follows the same\nrule as the overriding of a parent method. That is to say, the privacy\ndefined inside the trait must be the same as the privacy defined\ninside the implementation.\n1.3. Trait usage\nAs said in the beginning of this chapter, traits do not define\ntypes, thus they cannot be used to define the type of a variable. For\nexample, the following source code has no meaning, Printable\ndoes not define a type.\nmod main;\nimport std::io;\n\ntrait Printable {\n    pub def print (self);\n}\n\ndef foo  (a : Printable) {\n    a.print ();\n}\n\n\nErrors: \nError : expression used as a type\n --> main.yr:(8,15)\n 8  ┃ def foo  (a : Printable) {\n    ╋               ^^^^^^^^^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nIf the previous example, is not a valid ymir code, the behavior can\nstill be implemented in the language. Traits gain interest when\ncoupled with templates, and a template test can be used to check that\na class implement a trait. More complete information, and example\nabout templates, and traits specialization are presented in chapter\nTemplates,\nbut a brief example is presented in the following source code. In this\nexample, two classes U and V implement the trait\nPrintable. The function foo takes a parameter whose type\nis not specified but must implement the trait Printable.

Unlike, casting of integer values,\n(e.g. i32 to i64), because an object is an aliasable type,\nthe memory size of the object is not modified. Casting must respect\nmutability of the object value. Moreover, this cast can be made\nimplicitely, as it does not create any problem in memory. In the\nfollowing example, the class Bar inherits from the class\nFoo. A variable x is created, and is of type\n&Bar. At line 1, an implicit cast is made of a &Bar\nvalue to a &Foo value, the same cast is made but explicitely at\nline 1.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def foo (self) {\n        println (\"Foo\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub over foo (self) {\n        println (\"Bar\");\n    }\n}\n\ndef baz (f : &Foo) {\n    f.foo ();\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = Bar::new ();\n    baz (x);\n\n    let y = cast!{&Foo} (x);\n    y.foo ();\n}\n\n\nResults:\nBar\nBar\n1.1. Dynamic typeinfo\nOne can note from the above example, that when a variable contains a\nvalue of type &Foo, that does not necessarily mean that this is\na pure &Foo value, but it can be a &Bar. In object\noriented programming, this principle is denote polyphormism. In the\nchapter Basic programming\nconcepts,\nwe have seen that every object has specific attributes. Object is no\nexception to the rule. The following table lists the default specific\nattributes of the object types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ntypeid\nThe name of the type stored in a value of type [c32]\n\n\ntypeinfo\nA structure of type TypeInfo, containing information about the type\n\n\n\nThese attributes are compile time executed, and thus are static. For\nexample, in the following source code, the typeid of the class\nBar is printed to stdout, followed by a line that does exactly\nthe same thing (literraly).\ndef main () {\n    println (Bar::typeid);\n    println (\"main::Bar\");\n}\n\n\nWhen it comes to dynamic typing, it can be interesting to get the\ntypeinfo of the type of the value that is actually stored inside the\nvariable (e.g. get the typeinfo of the Bar class, type of the\nvalue contained inside a &Foo variable). To do that, the\nspecific attribute typeinfo of object is also accessible from\nthe value directly, and this time dynamically.\ndef main () {\n    let x = Bar::new ();\n    let y : &Foo = x;\n\n    println (y::typeinfo);\n}\n\n\nResults: \ncore::typeinfo::TypeInfo(13, 16, [core::typeinfo::TypeInfo(13, 16, [], main::Foo)], main::Bar)\n \nThe result presented above, gives the following information : 1)\nwe have a object, 2) its size is 16 bytes, 3) it has an ancestor\n(object, size 16 bytes, no ancestor, named main::Foo), 4) its\nname is main::Bar.\nThe TypeInfo returned by the typeinfo attributes (either\ndynamically or statically), is a structure whose definition is the\nfollowing. The inner fields depend on the value of the\ntypeid field, for example, when dealing with an object it stores\nthe ancestor TypeInfo, and when dealing with slice, it stores\nthe TypeInfo of the type contained inside the slice.\npub struct\n| typeid : TypeIDs\n| size   : usize\n| inner  : [TypeInfo]\n| name   : [c32] \n -> TypeInfo;\n\npub enum : u32\n| ARRAY        = 1u32\n| BOOL         = 2u32\n| CHAR         = 3u32\n| CLOSURE      = 4u32\n| FLOAT        = 5u32\n| FUNC_PTR     = 6u32\n| SIGNED_INT   = 7u32\n| UNSIGNED_INT = 8u32\n| POINTER      = 9u32\n| SLICE        = 10u32\n| STRUCT       = 11u32\n| TUPLE        = 12u32\n| OBJECT       = 13u32\n| VOID         = 14u32\n -> TypeIDs;\n\n\nThe typeinfo of a class is stored in the text and is accessible from\nthe vtable of the object. One can note that Bar and Foo\nhave a size of 16 bytes, despite the fact that they store no\nfields. This is due to two pointers that are stored inside every\nobjects, the first pointer is refering to the monitor of the object\n(cf. Parallelism), and the second one points the the vtable of\nthe object.\n1.2. Object\nYmir have a type named Object, that can used to cast any\nobject into that type. The reverse is impossible. We have seen that\nthe object are not inheriting from a global ancestor, and this is\nreally not the case. This cast unlike casting to parent class objects,\ncannot be made implicitely. We can see the &(Object) type as the\n&(void) type, that can store any pointer, but for\nobjects. Unlike &(void) (in which by the way we can't cast\nobjects), &Object stores one valuable information, it stores a\nvalid object value, with a vtable, a monitor, a typeinfo, and cannot\nbe null. \nIn the following example, a pattern matching is used to check the type\nof the object that is returned by the foo function. This is\ndiscussed in chapter Pattern\nMatching.\ndef foo ()-> &Object {\n    cast!{&Object} (Foo::new ())\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    match foo () {\n        Foo () => {\n            println (\"I got a Foo !\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nResults: \nI got a Foo !\n\nSome function of the standard library uses the Object type to\nreturn values, when it is impossible statically to get more accurate\ninformation about the type (e.g. [Packable]\n(https://gnu-ymir.github.io/Documentations/en/traits/serialize.html).)\n"},"functions/":{"url":"functions/","title":"Function advanced","keywords":"","body":"1. Functions1.1. Function pointer1.1.1. Function pointer using reference1.2. Lambda function1.3. Closure1.3.1. Copy closure1.3.2. Method delegate1.3.3. Polymorphic delegate1. Functions\nWe have seen in the chapter Basic programming\nconcepts\nhow functions are written. Ymir can be used as a functional\nlanguage, thus functions can also be considered as values. In this\nchapter we will see more advanced function systems, named function\npointer and closure.\n1.1. Function pointer\nA function pointer is a value that contains a function. It can be used\nfor example, to pass a function, as an argument to other\nfunctions. The type of a function pointer is written using the keyword\nfn, and have nearly the same syntax as a function prototype, but\nwithout a name, and without naming the parameters.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    f (41)\n}\n\ndef addOne (x : i32)-> i32\n    x + 1\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (&addOne);\n    println (x);\n}\n\n\nIn the above example, we have specified that the function foo\ntakes a function pointer as first parameter. This function pointer, is\na function that takes an i32 value and return another i32 value.\nIn the main function, the ampersand (&) unary operator is used\nto transform the function symbol addOne into a function\npointer. This function pointer is then passed to the function\nfoo, which calls it and return its value. \nResults: \n42\n1.1.1. Function pointer using reference\nWe have seen that references is not a type, in the chapter Alias and\nReferences. However,\nfunction prototype sometimes takes reference value as parameter. This\nmust be replicated in the prototype of the function pointer. For that\nreason, the ref keyword can be used in the prototype of a\nfunction pointer type. \nIn the following example, the function mutAddOne change the\nvalue of a reference variable x, and add one to it. The function\nfoo takes a function pointer as first parameter, and calls it on\na mutable local variable x by reference (it is important). \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (ref mut i32)-> void) -> i32 {\n    let mut x = 41;\n    f (ref x);\n    x\n}\n\ndef mutAddOne (ref mut x : i32) {\n    x = x + 1;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (&mutAddOne);\n    println (x);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n42\n\nThe prototype of the function pointer must be strictly respected, for\nobvious reasons. And as for normal functions, alias and references\nmust be strictly respected as well. For example, in the follow\nexample, the function foo tries to call the function pointer\nthat takes a reference argument, using a simple value. And the\nmain function tries to call the foo function, with a\nfunction pointer that does not take a reference parameter.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (ref mut i32)-> void) -> i32 {\n    let mut x = 41;\n    f (x);\n    x\n}\n\ndef mutAddOne (x : i32) {\n    println (x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (&mutAddOne);\n    println (x);\n}\n\n\nWe have two errors, first the compiler does not allow an implicit\nreferencing of the variable x at line 5, and second the\ncompiler does not allow an implicit cast of a value of type fn\n(i32)-> void to fn (ref mut i32)-> void.\nError : the call operator is not defined for &fn(ref mut i32)-> void and {mut i32}\n --> main.yr:(5,7)\n 5  ┃     f (x);\n    ╋       ^ ^\n    ┃ Error : implicit referencing of type mut i32 is not allowed\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(5,8)\n    ┃  5  ┃     f (x);\n    ┃     ╋        ^\n    ┃ Note : for parameter i32 --> main.yr:(3,26) of f\n    ┗━━━━━━ \n\nError : the call operator is not defined for main::foo and {&fn(i32)-> void}\n --> main.yr:(14,17)\n14  ┃     let x = foo (&mutAddOne);\n    ╋                 ^          ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate foo --> main.yr:(3,5) : main::foo (f : &fn(ref mut i32)-> void)-> i32\n    ┃     ┃ Error : incompatible types &fn(ref mut i32)-> void and &fn(i32)-> void\n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(14,18)\n    ┃     ┃ 14  ┃     let x = foo (&mutAddOne);\n    ┃     ┃     ╋                  ^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : for parameter f --> main.yr:(3,10) of main::foo (f : &fn(ref mut i32)-> void)-> i32\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\nError : undefined symbol x\n --> main.yr:(15,14)\n15  ┃     println (x);\n    ╋              ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.2. Lambda function\nLambda functions are anonymous functions that have the same behavior\nas normal function, but don't have a name. They are declared using the\ntoken | surrounding the parameters instead of parentheses in order\nto dinstinguish them from tuple. The following code block presents the\nsyntax of the lambda functions.\nlambda_func := '|' (var_decl (',' var_decl)*)? '|' ('->' type)? ('=>')? expression\nvar_decl := Identifier (':' type)?\n\n\nThe following example shows a simple usage of a lambda function. This\nfunction declared at line 4, and stored in the variable x,\ntakes two parameters x and y of type i32, and return\ntheir sum.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x : i32, y : i32|-> i32 { \n        x + y\n    };\n    println (x (1, 2));\n}\n\n\nAs one can note, there is no conflict between the variable x\ndeclared in the function main, and the first parameter of the\nlambda function also named x. This is due to the fact that the\nlambda function does not enclose the context of the function that have\ncreated it. In other words, lambda functions behave as normal local\nfunction, accessible only inside the function that have declared them\n(cf.  Scope\ndeclaration).\nIn many cases the type of the parameters and return type can be\ninfered, and are therefore optional. The above example can then be\nrewritten into the following example. In this next example, the lambda\nfunction can be called with any values, as long as the binary addition\n(+) operator is defined between the two values.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x, y| x + y;    \n    println (x (1, 2));\n\n\n    // The types are not given, then you can also write \n    println (x (1.3, 2.9));    \n}\n\n\nThe token => can be added after the prototype of the lambda, to make\nit a bit more readable. It is just syntaxic and has no impact on the\nbehavior of the lambda.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x, y| => x + y;    \n    println (x (1, 2));\n}\n\n\nLambda functions are directly function pointers, and then can be used\nas such without needing the unary ampersand (&) operator. In the\nfollowing example, the function foo takes a function pointer as\nfirst parameter, and two i32 values as second and third\nparameters. This function calls the function pointer twice, and add\nthe result. A lambda function is used in the main function as\nthe first argument for the foo function.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (i32, i32)-> i32, x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 {\n    f (x, y) + f (y, x)\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (|x, y|=> x * y).foo (3, 7);\n\n    // uniform call syntax is used, but you can of course write it as follows : \n    // foo (|x, y| x*y, 3, 7);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nResults: \n42\n\nLambda function that are not typed are special element, that does not\nreally have a value at runtime, and are closer to compile time\nvalues (presented in a future chapter Compile time\nexecution).\nWhen the whole type of a lambda cannot be infered by the compiler\n(types of the parameters, and the type of the return type), then the\nvalue cannot be passed to a mutable variable. Ymir allows to put an\nuntyped lambda inside an immutable var, to ease its usage, but the\nlambda still does not have any value. For that reason, the second line\nof the following example is possible, but not the third.\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x| x + 1;\n    let mut y = x;\n}\n\n\nErrors: \nError : the type mut fn (any)-> any is not complete\n --> main.yr:(2,10)\n 2  ┃     let x = |x| x + 1;\n    ╋             ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(3,10)\n    ┃  3  ┃     let mut y = x;\n    ┃     ╋             ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nThe same problem happens when an uncomplete lambda function is used as\nthe value of a function. To resolve the problem, and because the\nreturn type of a function is always complete when the function is\nvalidated (or there were other previous errors), the keyword\nreturn can be used. Thanks to that statement, the compiler has\nadditional knowledge, and can infer the type of the lambda function\nfrom the return type of the function.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> fn (i32)-> i32 {\n    return |x| => x + 12 // the compiler tries to transform the lambda function into a function pointer fn (i32)-> i32\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo ();\n    println (x (30));\n}\n\n\nContribution: Resolve that problem when it seems obvious, for\nexample in the previous example, maybe the type of the block can be\ninfered directly?\n1.3. Closure\nAs said earlier, a lambda function behave like a local private\nfunction, and thus has no access to the context of the function that\nhave declared it. In the following example, the lambda function\ndeclared at line 5 tries to access the variable i declared\nat line 4. This is impossible, the variable i exists in a\ndifferent context that the lambda function.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let i = 12;\n    let x = | | {\n        println (i);\n    };\n    x ();\n}\n\n\nErrors:\nError : undefined symbol i\n --> main.yr:(6,12)\n 6  ┃         println (i);\n    ╋                  ^\n\nError : undefined symbol x\n --> main.yr:(8,2)\n 8  ┃     x ();\n    ╋     ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\nClosure are a function pointer that capture the environment of the\nfunction that has declared them. In Ymir there is only one kind of\naccepted closure, that is called the move closure.\n1.3.1. Copy closure\nA copy closure is a special kind of lambda function, that is declared\nby using the keyword move in front of a lambda literal. The\nclosure as an immutable access to all the variable declared inside the\nscope of the parent function. This closure is called a copy closure\nbecause the access of the variable is made by copy (a first level copy\ncf. Copy and Deep\ncopy).\nBecause closure captures a context in addition to a function pointer,\nthe simple function pointer type is no more sufficient, and a new type\nis introduced. The syntax of the closure type is created with the\nkeyword dg instead of fn (dg stands for delegate). A\ndelegate is a function pointer with an environment, and is the general\ncase of a closure (we will see in next section, a case of delegate\nthat are not closure).\nIn the following example, the copy closure declared at line 9\nenclosed the scope of the function foo, and thus has access to\nthe variable i. However, the enclosed variable is immutable (and\nis a copy).\nimport std::io\n\ndef bar (f : dg (i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    f (12)\n}\n\ndef foo () {\n    let i = 30;\n    let x = bar (move |x|=> x + i);\n    println (x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\n\nThe above source code in the context of the foo function, can be\nillustrated by the following figure.\n\n\n\nAs one can note, the variable i enclosed in the closure is not\nthe same as the variable i of the main function. This has\ntwo impact: \n\na) copy closure can be returned safely from functions,\nindeed even when the variable i does not exist anymore as the\nfunction foo is exited, a copy of it is still accessible in the\nheap (note that this is the same for aliasable types, that are in the\nheap in any case). For example: \n\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo ()-> dg ()-> i32 {\n    let i = 30;\n    return (move || => i + 12);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo ();\n    println (x ()); // enclosed i does not exists, but thats not a problem\n}\n\n\nResults:\n42\n\n\nb) the value of the enclosed i is independant\nfrom the value of the variable i in the foo function,\nmeaning that there is no way for the foo function to change the\nvalue of the variable i inside the closure after its creation. For example : \n\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut i = 30;\n    let x = move || => i + 12;\n    i = 11; // no impact on the closure of x\n    println (x ());    \n\n    let y = move || => i + 12;\n    println (y ());\n}\n\n\nResults: \n42\n23\n\nBy using aliasable types, this limitation can be bypassed, for example\na slice can be used to enclosed the value of i, and access it from the\nclosure, without removing the guarantees of the copy closure, this\nis illustrated in the following example. Warning: if you might be\ntempted to use a pointer on the i variable, its highly not\nrecommended. Indeed, pointing to a local variable remove the guarantee\nwe introduced earlier in the point (a) - (in general using pointer -\nnot function pointer - to value is a bad idea, and should be\nprohibited outside the std).\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    let dmut i = [12];\n    let x = move || => {\n        i[0] + 12\n    } catch {\n        _ => {\n            0\n        }\n    };\n\n    i [0] = 30;\n    println (x ());\n}\n\n\nIn the above example, the copy closure access to the first index of\nthe slice i. This is a unsafe operation, the slice can be empty,\nthis is why a catch is made. Information about catch is not presented\nhere, and will be discussed in a future chapter Error\nhandling. Here\nbecause the slice is not empty when the closure is called, the access\nworks.\nResults: \n42\n1.3.2. Method delegate\nA method is a function pointer associated with a object instance, then\nthey can be seen as delegate. The name closure is not used here,\nbecause nothing is really enclosed as in copy closure over function\ncontext, so the name delegate being a more global term is used. A\ndelegate is a function operating on an object, for which we don't know\nthe exact type. \nA method can be transformed into a delegate using the unary ampersand\n(&) operator, on a method associated to an object instance. \nimport std::io;\n\nclass Foo {\n    pub let mut i = 0;\n\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def foo (self) -> void {\n        println (self.i);\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut a = Foo::new (), dmut b = Foo::new ();\n    let x : (dg ()-> void) = &a.foo;\n    let y = &b.foo;\n\n    a.i = 89;\n    b.i = 42;\n\n    x ();\n    y ();    \n}\n\n\nResults: \n89\n42\n\nUnlike copy closure a method can have a mutable access to the object\nassociated to it. In that case, an explicit alias must be made on the\nobject instance, when creating the delegate, otherwise the compiler\nthrows an error. \nimport std::io;\n\nclass Foo {\n    let mut _i = 0;\n\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def foo (mut self) {\n        self._i = 42;\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut a = Foo::new ();\n\n    let x = &(a.foo);\n\n    x ();\n\n    println (a);\n\n}\n\n\nErrors:\nError : undefined operator & for type (a).foo\n --> main.yr:(18,13)\n18  ┃     let x = &(a.foo);\n    ╋             ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate foo --> main.yr:(8,13) : (mut self) => main::Foo::foo ()-> void\n    ┃     ┃ Error : discard the constant qualifier is prohibited, left operand mutability level is 2 but must be at most 1\n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(18,13)\n    ┃     ┃ 18  ┃     let x = &(a.foo);\n    ┃     ┃     ╋             ^\n    ┃     ┃     ┃ Note : implicit alias of type mut &(mut main::Foo) is not allowed, it will implicitly discard constant qualifier\n    ┃     ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(18,15)\n    ┃     ┃     ┃ 18  ┃     let x = &(a.foo);\n    ┃     ┃     ┃     ╋               ^\n    ┃     ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\nError : undefined symbol x\n --> main.yr:(20,5)\n20  ┃     x ();\n    ╋     ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nThis can be easily resolved by aliasing the variable a when\ncreating the delegate.

The pattern matching syntax always start with the\nkeyword match followed by an expression, and then a list of patterns\nenclosed between {}.\nThe syntax of the pattern matching is described in the following code block.\nmatch := 'match' expression '{' pattern* '}'\npattern := pattern_expression '=>' expression (';')?\n\npattern_expression :=   pattern_tuple \n                      | pattern_option \n                      | pattern_range \n                      | pattern_var \n                      | pattern_call\n                      | expression\n\npattern_tuple := '(' (pattern_expression (',' pattern_expression)*)? ')'\npattern_option := pattern_expression ('|' pattern_expression)*\npattern_range := pattern_expression ('..' | '...') pattern_expression \npattern_var := (Identifier | '_') ':' (type | '_') ('=' pattern_expression)?\npattern_call := (type | '_') '(' (pattern_argument (',' pattern_argument)*)? ')'\npattern_arguments := (Identifier '->')? pattern_expression\n\n\nMatch is a kind of control flow, relatively close to if\nexpressions. As if expressions, a match expression can have a\nvalue. In that case, every branch of the match must share the same\ntype, and there must be a guarantee that at least one test of the\nmatch succeed, and thus that a branch is entered. For example, in\nthe following example, all the branch of the match share the same\ntype i32, however it is possible (and even inevitable in that\nspecific case), that no branch of the match were entered. So the\ncompiler throws an error, as the variable x might be unset,\nwhich is prohibited by the language. In the following example, simple\ntests are made on the value, so the first pattern is equal to an if\nexpression, where the test is 12 == 1.\ndef main () {\n    let x = match (12) {\n        1 => 8\n        2 => 7\n        3 => 6\n    };\n}\n\n\nErrors : \nError : match of type i32 has no default match case\n --> main.yr:(2,10)\n 2  ┃     let x = match (12) {\n    ╋             ^^^^^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.1. Matching on everything\nThe token _ declares a pattern test that is always valid. It can\nbe placed at different level of the pattern test, as we will see in\nthe rest of this chapter.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    match 42 {\n        _ => { println (\"Always true\"); }\n    }\n}\n\n\n1.2. Matching over a range of values\nPattern matching aims to be more expressive than if expressions, and\ntherefore to allow faster writting of complex test. For example, to\ncheck wether a value is included in an interval of values, writing the\ninterval in the test of the pattern is sufficient. In the following\nexample, the first pattern can be rewritten as the following if\nexpression : 1  42, the second into : 10 = 42, and the third one into : 42 == 41 || 42 == 42 || 42\n== 43.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    match 42 {\n        1 .. 10 => {\n            println (\"The answer is between 1 and 10 not included\");\n        }\n        10 ... 40 {\n            println (\"The answer is between 10 and 40 included\");\n        }\n        41 | 42 | 43 => {\n            println (\"The answer is either 41, 42 or 43\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe pattern are tested in the order they are written in the source\ncode, thus if two pattern are valid, only the first one is\nentered. For example, in the following source code, only the pattern\nat line 5 is entered, and the pattern at line 6, even if\nit is valid, is simply ignored.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    match 42 {\n        1 .. 100 => { println (\"Between 1 and 100\"); }\n        10 .. 100 => { println (\"Between 10 and 100\"); }\n    }\n}\n\n1.3. Variable pattern\nA variable declaration can be used to store a value during the pattern\nmatching. The variable is declared like a standard variable\ndeclaration but with keyword let ommitted. The variable pattern\ncan also be used to match over the type of the expression that is\ntested, when the type of the variable can be dynamic (e.g. on class\ninheritance). In all other cases the test is done during the\ncompilation, and the type of the newly declared variable must in any\ncase be fully compatible with the type of the value that is tested. In\nthe following example, the type of the variable patterns is always\ni32, because it is the only compatible type with the type of the\nvalue.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    match 13 {\n        _ : i32 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, but I don't care about the value\");\n        }\n        _ : i32 = 13 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, whose value is 13\");\n        }\n        _ : _ = 13 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, whose value is 13, but I didn't checked the type\");\n        }        \n        x : i32 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, and the value is : \", x);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn the above example, every pattern tests are valid, but only the first pattern\nis evaluated, leading to the following result. \nIt is a i32, but I don't care about the value\n\nOne can note that the token : is important in that case, even if\nthe type is not mandatory and can be omitted (by replacing it with the\ntoken _). This is to distinguish a variable declaration to a\nsimple variable referencing. For example, in the following source\ncode, a variable x is declared before the pattern matching, and\nits value is compared with the value that is tested in the match. A\nsecond pattern declares a variable y.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 42;\n    match 42 {\n        x => { println (\"x == 42\"); } // simple test on the variable declare 2 lines above\n        y : _ => { println (y); } // declaration of a new variable y that stores the matched value \n    }\n\n}\n\n\nResults: \nx == 42\n\n1.3.1. Matching over type\nWhen the type of the value that is tested can be dynamic (i.e. class\ninheritance, which is the only possibility), then the type of the\nvariable in the test can be used to test the type of the value. In the\nfollowing example, the class Bar and Baz inherit from the\nabstract class Foo. The variable x declared in the\nmain function, is of type Foo meaning that it can contains\neither a Bar or a Baz value. The match expression then\nmake a test over the type of the variable x.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass @abstract Foo {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Bar over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\nclass Baz over Foo {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo ()-> &Foo {\n    Bar::new ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo ();\n    match x {\n        _ : &Bar => println (\"Contains a Bar\");\n        _ : &Baz => println (\"Contains a Baz\");        \n    }\n}\n\n\nResults: \nContains a Bar\n\nThere is another pattern that can be used to test a dynamic type, that\nis presented in a following sub section (cf. Destructuring class),\nbut pattern matching is the only way to cast a value whose type is an\nancestor class to an heir class, and this way is safe. In many\nlanguage like Java, D or C++, it is possible to use the casting\nsystem, that has a undefined behavior in C++, makes the program crash\nin Java, and returns the value null in D. These three behaviors are\nnot acceptable since they are not safe. By using the pattern matching,\nthe failing case is let to the discretion of the user. And as we have\nseen in the introduction of this chapter, because a match can't have a\nvalue if there is a possibility that none of the branch were entered,\nthen the user has to write a default case when the cast failed if they\nwant to retreive a value from the matching. This default case can of\ncourse be used to throw an exception (cf Error\nhandling).\n1.3.2. Reference variable\nA mutable value can be updated inside a pattern, by using a reference\nvariable. This works exactly like variable referencing (as presented\nin chapter\nReferences).\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut z = 1;\n    match ref z {\n        // ^^^\n        // ref is important here, otherwise the compiler throw an error\n        ref mut x : _ => {\n            x = 42;\n        }\n    }\n\n    println (z);\n}\n\n1.4. Destructuring patterns\nDestructuring patterns are patterns that divide the values contained\nin a value is type is a compound type. Compound types are 1) tuple, 2)\nstructures and 3) classes. \n1.4.1. Destructuring a tuple\nTo destructure a tuple, parentheses surrounding other patterns are\nused. The arity of the destructuring pattern must be the same as the\narity of the tuple that is destructured. In the following example, a\ntuple of arity 3, and type (i32, c32, f64) is\ndestructured, using two different patterns. The first pattern only\ncheck the first value of the tuple (the other are always true, using\nthe token _), by verifying that the value is equals to 1\nand putting it in the variable i. The second pattern does not do\nany tests but associate the values of the tuple to the variable\nx, y and z. As one can note from that test, any\npattern can be used to test inner values of the tuple, (another\ndestructuring pattern if the inner value is a compound type, a range\npattern, etc.)\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let tuple = (1, 'x', 3.14)\n\n    match tuple {\n        (i : i32 = 1, _, _) => {\n            println (\"This tuple has an arity of three and its first element is an i32, whose value \", i, \" == 1\");\n        } \n        (x : _, y : _, z : _) => {\n            println (\"This tuple has an arity of three, and its values are : (\", x, \", \", y, \", \", z, \")\");\n        }        \n    }\n}\n\n\nResults: \nThis tuple has an arity of three and its first element is an i32, whose value 1 == 1\n1.4.2. Destructuring structure\nDestructuring structure is made by using a call expression. The\nargument of the call expressions are patterns. Unlike tuple\ndestructuring, there is no need to test all the values of the\nstructure, but only those which are relevant. The order of the fields\nis respected in the destructuring (i.e. the pattern, at line 15 of the\nfollowing example, tests the value of the field x). Named\nexpressions can be used to test specific fields of the structure.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct\n| x : i32\n| y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let p = Point (1, 2);\n\n    match p {\n        Point (y-> 1) => {\n            println (\"Point where y is equal to 1\");\n        }\n        Point (1) => {\n            println (\"Point where x is equal to 1\");\n        }\n        Point () => {\n            println (\"Any point\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nOf course, any kind of pattern can be used inside a structure\ndestructuring, for example a variable pattern, that refers to the\nvalues later in the content of the pattern. In the following example,\na variable p is declared to refer to the value contained in the\nvariable point, and a variable y is declared to refer to\nthe value contained in the field point.y.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct\n| x : i32\n| y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let point = Point (1, 2);\n\n    match point {\n        p : _ = Point (y-> y : i32) => {\n            println (p, \" is a point, whose y field is equal to \", y);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n1.4.3. Destructuring class\nThe syntax for destructuring object is the same as the syntax for\ndestructuring structure. However, only named expressions are\nadmitted, and this expressions refer to object fields that must be\npublic in the context of the pattern matching. For example, in the\nsource code below, the field x of the class Point is\npublic from the context of the main function, for that reason it\nis accessible inside the class destructuring pattern. On the other\nhand the field _y is private for the main function, thus\ncannot be used.\nimport std::io\n\nclass Point {\n    pub let x : i32 = 1;\n    let _y : i32 = 2;\n\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let p = Point::new ();\n\n    match p {\n        Point (x-> 1, _y-> 2) => {\n            println (p.x, \" is a equal to 1\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nErrors: \nError : undefined field _y for element &(main::Point)\n --> main.yr:(14,17)\n14  ┃         Point (x-> 1, _y-> 2) => {\n    ╋                       ^\n    ┃ Note : i32 --> main.yr:(5,11) : _y is private within this context\n    ┗━━━━━━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nWe have seen in a previous section (cf. Matching over type), that\nbecause class types are dynamic when there is inheritance, pattern\nmatching can be used to test the type of the values. Class\ndestructuring is an alternative way to check the type of a value,\nwhose type is a class that have heirs. The following example,\ndemonstrate the use of the pattern matching to retreive the center of\na Shape when it is a Circle. In this example, the\nfoo function lied, and returned a Rectangle instead of a\nCircle, in order to be compilable the source code must manage\nthat case, otherwise the variable center declared at line\n28 could be unset, and that is prohibited by the language.\nimport std::io\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Rectangle over Shape {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    pub let center : i32 ;\n\n    pub self (center : i32) with center = center {}\n}\n\n/**\n * Don't worry I will return you a circle\n*/\ndef foo () -> &Shape {\n    Rectangle::new ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let circle = foo ();\n    let center = match circle {\n        Circle (center-> c : _) => c\n    };\n    println (\"The center of the circle is : \", center);\n}\n\n\nErrors: \nError : match of type i32 has no default match case\n --> main.yr:(28,15)\n28  ┃     let center = match circle {\n    ╋                  ^^^^^\n\nError : undefined symbol center\n --> main.yr:(31,45)\n31  ┃     println (\"The center of the circle is : \", center);\n    ╋                                                ^^^^^^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nThis can be corrected by adding a default case to the match\nexpression. The following source codes are two possibilities.\n\n1) Setting a default value : \n\ndef main () {\n    let circle = foo ();\n    let center = match circle {\n        Circle (center-> c : _) => c\n        _ => {\n            println (\"Foo lied ....\");\n            0 // center is equal to 0, if foo returned something other than a Circle\n        }\n    };\n    println (\"The center of the circle is : \", center);\n}\n\n\n2) Throwing an error (cf. Error\nhandling)\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let circle = foo ();\n    let center = match circle {\n        Circle (center-> c : _) => c\n        _ => {\n            throw AssertError::new (\"Foo lied...\");\n        }\n    };\n    println (\"The center of the circle is : \", center);\n}\n\n\nA pattern using an ancestor class, will succeed if the object instance\nthat is used is a heir class. That is to say, if the pattern tries to\nget a Shape value, when giving a Circle value to the\npattern, the pattern test succeeds. So the order has to be carefully\nset (putting heir class tests first). The phenomenon is the same with\nvariable patterns. Contribution Add verification when a pattern\ntest cannot be entered because previous test is always valid.\ndef main () {\n    let circle : &Shape = Circle::new (); // Important to have a &Shape, and not a &Circle\n    match circle {\n        Shape () => {\n            println (\"Shape\");\n        }\n        Circle () => {\n            println (\"Circle\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nResults: \nShape\n"},"errors/main.html":{"url":"errors/main.html","title":"Error handling","keywords":"","body":"1. Error handling1.1. Assert1.2. Rethrowing1. Error handling\nThis section will introduce error handling in the Ymir language. As\nwith many languages, error are managed by throwing\nexceptions. Exception can be recovered thanks to scope guards that\nmanage the errors in different manners. The keyword throw is used to\nthrow an exception when an error occurs in the program. An exception\nis a class that inherits the core class core::exception::Exception.\nExceptions are always recoverable, and must be managed by the user,\nwho cannot simply ignore them. Ymir does not allow the possibility\nto ignore that an exception is thrown in a function, and may cause the\nfunction to exit prematurely. To avoid this possibility, excpetion\nmust be written in the definition of the function, or managed\ndirectly.\n// Exception is defined in a core module, so does not need import \nclass MyError over Exception {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws &MyError\n{\n    throw MyError::new ();\n}\n\n1.1. Assert\nWe have seen in previous section the assert expression. This simple\nexpression throws an &AssertError value when the condition is\nnot valid. AssertError is a common exception defined in a core\nfile (that does not need to be imported).\ndef main () \n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let i = 11;\n    assert (i \n1.2. Rethrowing\nThe error rethrowing is a way of defining that a function could throw\nan exception, and that this exception must be taking into account by\nthe caller functions. It is a system relatively close to error\nrethrowing of the Java language, apart that the specific name of the\nexception must be written in the possible rethrowed exceptions. That\nis to say, it is impossible to write that a function throws a parent\nclass of the actually thrown exception (e.g. &Exception, when\nthe function actually throws &AssertError). Thanks to that, the\ncompiler is always able to check the type of the exceptions, and can\nforce the user to handle them.\nIn the following example, the function foo is an unsafe function\nthat can throw the exception &AssertError. This exception is\nthrown by the function assert at line 6, and is not\nmanaged by the function foo. Because the main function\ncalls the foo function, it is also unsafe, and also throws the\nexception &AssertError. In this example, the program stops,\nbecause of an unhandled exception. \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) \n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    assert (i \n\nResults (in debug mode, -g option): \nUnhandled exception\nException in file \"/home/emile/ymir/Runtime/midgard/core/exception.yr\", at line 84, in function \"core::exception::abort\", of type core::exception::AssertError.\n╭  Stack trace :\n╞═ bt ╕ #1\n│     ╘═> /lib/libgyruntime.so:??\n╞═ bt ╕ #2\n│     ╘═> /lib/libgyruntime.so:??\n╞═ bt ╕ #3 in function core::exception::abort (...)\n│     ╘═> /home/emile/ymir/Runtime/midgard/core/exception.yr:84\n╞═ bt ╕ #4 in function main::foo (...)\n│     ╘═> /home/emile/Documents/test/ymir/main.yr:7\n╞═ bt ╕ #5 in function main (...)\n│     ╘═> /home/emile/Documents/test/ymir/main.yr:10\n╞═ bt ╕ #6\n│     ╘═> /lib/libgyruntime.so:??\n╞═ bt ╕ #7 in function main\n│     ╘═> /home/emile/Documents/test/ymir/main.yr:10\n╞═ bt ╕ #8\n│     ╘═> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6:??\n╞═ bt ═ #9 in function _start\n╰\nAborted (core dumped)\n\nThe compiler does not allow to forget the possibility of a error\nthrowing, and requires the user to write it down.

In the following example, the main\nfunction calls the foo function, that throws an\n&AssertError. The call is guarded by a catch expression, that\ncatch every kind of Exception (using the _ token). Because\nthe exception of the foo function is caught the main\nfunction is considered safe, and thus cannot throw an exception, this\nis why nothing is declared in its prototype. In this example, the\nprogram ends normaly, after exiting the main function.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (i : i32) \n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    assert (i  {\n            println (\"Foo failed\");\n        }\n    }\n    println (\"After foo\");\n}\n\n\nResults: \nBefore foo\nFoo failed\nAfter foo\n\nA variable pattern can also be used to get the value of the\nexception.

In\ndebug mode (-g option of the compiler), when throwing an\nexception, the stack trace is accessible and printed, when printing an\nexception.

In the following example, the foo function, can throw\ntwo different kind of exception, &AssertError and\n&OutOfArray. The catch of the main function has a\ndifferent behavior if the exception that is thrown is a\n&AssertError or a &OutOfArray, (by using a variable pattern\nfor &AssertError, and a call pattern for &OutOfArray).\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (i : [i32]) \n    throws &AssertError, &OutOfArray\n{\n    assert (i [0]  {\n            println (\"Foo failed : \", err);\n        }\n        OutOfArray () => {\n            println (\"Foo failed, the slice was empty\");\n        }\n    }\n    println (\"After foo\");\n}\n\n\nResults: \nBefore foo\nFoo failed, the slice was empty\nAfter foo\n\n1.3. Rethrowing exceptions\nCatch scope guard must catch every exceptions that are thrown by the\nscope that is guarded. For example, if the main function of the\nprevious example, was defined as presented in the next code block, the\ncompiler would have returned an error. Indeed, in this example, the\n&OutOfArray exception is not managed by the catch guard.\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Before foo\");\n    { \n        foo ([]); \n    } catch {\n        err : &AssertError => {\n            println (\"Foo failed : \", err);\n        }\n    }\n    println (\"After foo\");\n}\n\n\nErrors:\nError : the exception &(core::array::OutOfArray) might be thrown but is not caught\n --> main.yr:(13,7)\n13  ┃         foo ([]); \n    ╋             ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(14,4)\n    ┃ 14  ┃     } catch {\n    ┃     ╋       ^^^^^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nThe OutOfArray exception can be rethrown inside the catch\nscope guard to remove this error.

Catch as a value\nIn some cases (many cases), a scope is used to compute a value. In\nthat circumstance, if an error occurs inside the scope, the value of\nthe scope is not set, and cannot be used. For example, in the\nfollowing source code, the main function tries to initialize a\nvariable from the value of the foo function. This function is\nnot safe, and might return no value at all. In order to guarantee,\nthat the variable x is initialized, and usable no matter what\nhappened in the foo function, the catch scope guard can be\nused as the default value. This is presented as well at line 21\nto initialize the variable y.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (i : i32) \n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    assert (i  {\n            println (\"Foo failed\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    let y = {\n        foo (10)\n    } catch {\n        _ => {\n            42\n        }\n    }\n\n    println (y);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nFoo failed\n42\n\nBecause, the catch scope guard is a pattern matching, multiple\nbranch can be entered. In that case, every branch of the catch guard\nmust share the same type. In the following example, the value y\nis set conditionaly, depending on the type of exception that is thrown\nby the foo function, or if the function foo succeeds. In\nthis example, the foo function throws a &OutOfArray\nexception, thus the variable y is set to 42 (value\ncomputed at line 19).\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (i : [i32]) -> i32\n    throws &AssertError, &OutOfArray\n{\n    assert (i[0]  {\n            11\n        }\n        OutOfArray () => {\n            42\n        }\n    }\n\n    println (y);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n42\n1.5. Catch along other scope guards\nCatch scope guards can be used along other scope guards, (success,\nfailure and exit), but there can be only one catch scope guard\nper scope . In that case the priority is the following: 1) failure,\n2) catch, 3) exit. If there is a success scope guard that is\nexecuted, then the catch scope guard cannot be executed, so the\npriority over these two guards is not defined.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (i : [i32]) \n    throws &AssertError, &OutOfArray\n{\n    assert (i [0]  {\n            println (\"Foo failed : \", err);\n        }\n        _ : &OutOfArray => {\n            println (\"Out\");\n        }\n    } success {\n        println (\"Succ\");\n    } failure {\n        println (\"Fails\");\n    } exit {\n        println (\"Exit\");\n    }\n    println (\"After foo\");\n}\n\n\nResults:\nBefore foo\nFails\nOut\nExit\nAfter foo\n\nThe behavior is exactly the same when catch scope guard has a value.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (i : [i32]) -> i32\n    throws &AssertError, &OutOfArray\n{\n    assert (i[0]  {\n            println (\"Assert\");\n            11\n        }\n        OutOfArray () => {\n            println (\"Out\");\n            42\n        }\n    } failure {\n        println (\"Fails\");\n    } exit {\n        println (\"Exit\");\n    }\n\n    println (y);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nFails\nOut\nExit\n42\n"},"errors/option.html":{"url":"errors/option.html","title":"Exception and option type","keywords":"","body":"1.

Templates\nThe templates system provide the possibility to reuse source code,\nthat is valid for multiple types. The template system of Ymir is\npowerful, and allows the generation of code, that will be used many\ntimes for many purpose, by writting minimal source code, and\nconditional compilation. Templates is a main part of the Ymir\nlanguage, and almost everything in the standard library is written\nusing templates. It is important to understand the template system, to\nuse the language.\n1.1. Template definition syntax\nMultiple symbols in Ymir can be templates. Every template symbol has\na name, and the template parameters are following that name enclosed\nbetween curly brackets (this time they are always mandatory). For\nexample, a function can be a template, as it can be seen in the\nfollowing example. In this example, the function foo takes a\ntype as template parameter, and this type is named T in the\nfunction symbol, and is used as the type of the first parameter of the\nfunction (i.e. the type of the parameter a). By convention, the\nidentifiers of the template parameters are in upper case, however that\nis not mandatory.\ndef foo {T} (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\n\nOther symbols can also be templates. These symbols are : \n\nClasses\nStructures\nEnumerations\nLocal modules\nTraits\nAka\n\nThe templates arguments always follows the name of the symbol. In the\nfollowing example, templates are defined for various symbols.\nclass A {T} {\n    let value : T;\n\n    pub self (v : T) with value = v {}\n}\n\nstruct \n| x : T\n-> S {T};\n\nenum \n| X = cast!T (12)\n-> F {T};\n\nmod Inner {T} {\n    pub def foo (a : T) {\n        println (a);\n    }\n}\n\ntrait Z {T} {\n    pub def foo (self, a : T)-> T;\n}\n\naka X {T} = cast!T (12);\n\n\n1.2. Template argument syntax\nThe template call syntax is declared using the token !, followed\nby one are multiple arguments, enclosed inside curly\nbrackets. Template arguments are elements that must be known by the\ncompiler at compile time, in order to produce a valid template\nspecialization and create a symbol that can be used and is fully\nvalidated (i.e. where every types are correctly defined). The\nfollowing code block present the syntax of the template\ncall. Template call is a high priority expression, that has a even\nhigher level of priority than the :: operator, and unary\noperators. Operator priority is presented in the chapter Operator\npriority.\ntemplate_call := expression (single_arg | multiple_args) \nsingle_arg := '!' expression \nmultiple_args := '!' '{' (expression | template_call) (',' (expression | template_call))*)?

Template instanciation\nWhen a template symbol is defined, the template call is used to\nreference it, and make a specialization. The arguments used in the\ntemplate call are associated to the template parameters of the\ntemplate symbol, in the order they are defined. In the following\nexample, a function foo has a template argument, that must be a\ntype, and is named T. The main function use the template\ncall syntax to use that symbol, and associate to T the type\ni32. The symbol with a i32 is then created by the\ncompiler, and the main function calls it using the standard call\nsyntax using the parentheses operator.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {T} (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!i32 (42);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n42\n\nWhen the template symbol is a function, it can happened that the\ntemplate parameters can be infered from the parameters of the\nfunction. For example in the above example, there is no need to\nspecify a template call, and the standard call expression is\nsufficient.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {T} (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (42); // T, is infered as i32\n    foo (\"Hi !!\"); // T, is infered as a [c32]\n}\n\n\nResults: \n42\nHi !!\n\nThis cannot be done for structure or module. However, this is possible\nto do on classes, and this will be presented a little later, in the\nfollowing section of the chapter. \nWe have seen in the chapter about\nfunction (cf.\nFunctions),\nthe uniform call syntax. This syntax is also applicable on template\nfunctions. In the following example, a function that takes two types\nas template parameters is called in the main function.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {T} (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    (42).foo (); \n}\n\n1.2.2. Multiple template parameters\nAs said earlier the parameters are specialized using the arguments of\nthe template call syntax in the order they are presented. For\nexample, in the following example, the template call syntax at line\n1 creates a symbol where T=i32, and U=f64.\ndef foo {T, U} () {}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!{i32, f64} ();\n}\n\n\nIt is not necessary to put all the argument in the other template\nparameters can be infered from the previous template arguments, or by\nthe parameters of the function. We will see in a next chapter some way\nto determine the kind of type that can be used in a template symbol,\nbut briefly in the following example, the foo function only\naccepts types that are slices of U, where U can\nbe any type. In that case, because T can be used to infer the\ntype of U, there is no need to specify the type of U\nexplicitly.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {T of [U], U} () {\n    println (\"T=\", T::typeid, \" U=\", U::typeid);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo![i32] ();\n}\n\n\nResults: \nT=[i32] U=i32\n\nThe same behavior can be observed when the type can be infered from a\nstandard parameter of the function. In the following example, the type\nT is defined by the template call syntax, but the type U\nis defined by the first argument of the standard call. Thus, type\nT is i32, and type U is f64.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {T, U} (a : U) {\n    println (\"T=\", T::typeid, \" U=\", U::typeid, \" a=\", a, \"\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!i32 (3.14);\n}\n\n\nResults:\nT=i32 U=f64 a=3.140000\n\nOne can note that the type T cannot be infered from anything\naside the template call. Thus it has to be the first template\nparameter, otherwise the template call would have defined the type\nU. In the following example, the parameter T and U\nhave been reversed, but the call is the same. In that case, the\ncompiler fails to create a valid symbol and throws an error.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {U, T} (a : U) {\n    println (\"T=\", T::typeid, \" U=\", U::typeid, \" a=\", a, \"\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!i32 (3.14); // set U to i32, and T cannot be infered\n}\n\n\nErrors (in this error, we can see that U is set to i32 at line 10, and that the compiler failed to set T) :\nError : the call operator is not defined for foo {T}(a : U)-> void and {f64}\n --> main.yr:(8,10)\n 8  ┃     foo!i32 (3.14);\n    ╋             ^    ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate foo --> main.yr:(3,5) : foo {T}(a : U)-> void\n    ┃     ┃ Error : unresolved template\n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(3,13)\n    ┃     ┃  3  ┃ def foo {U, T} (a : U) {\n    ┃     ┃     ╋             ^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : for : foo --> main.yr:(3,5) with (U = i32)\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nUsing the template call syntax to set only a part of the template\nsymbols is named a two time template validation. We will see in the\nnext chapter, that template specialization can be very powerful and\ncan be used to choose between multiple template symbols. Refering to a\ntemplate symbol without using the template call syntax can be seen\nas a special case of two time validation, where the template call\nis made but with no arguments. \n1.2.3. Template class instanciation\nWhen a class template is declared, the compiler is sometimes able to\ninfer the type of the templates from the argument passed to the\nconstructors. The rule is the same as for function instanciation. In\nthe following example, the class X is a template class that\ntakes two types as template parameters. The main function\ninstanciate a X class at line 10 without using the\ntemplate call syntax. This is possible, because the constructor of\nthe class at line 6 is sufficient to infer the types T and\nU exactly as it would be done if it was a function\ntemplate. Because T and U has no restriction any type can\nbe used.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass X {T, U} {\n    let x : T, y : U;\n\n    pub self (x : T, y : U) with x = x, y = y {}    \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = X::new (1, 'r');\n    let b = X::new ([1, 2], \"foo\");\n\n    println (a::typeinfo.name);\n    println (b::typeinfo.name);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nmain::X(i32,c32)::X\nmain::X([i32],[c32])::X\n\nA two time validation can also be used to set the types of a part of\nthe template parameters, and let the other be infered by the\nconstructor call. In the following example, the type T is set by\nthe template call syntax, and the type U is infered from the\ntype of the parameter y of the constructor (here c32).\nimport std::io;\n\nclass X {T, U} {\n    let y : U;\n\n    pub self (y : U) with y = y {}    \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = X!(i32)::new ('r');\n    println (x::typeinfo.name);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nmain::X(i32,c32)::X\nContribution other template symbols cannot be called without\ntemplate call. This is normal for modules, traits, and enumeration,\nas nothing can be used to infer the types. But structures are called\nusing arguments, that are used to set the values of the fields, this\nis thus possible to infer the templates types in that case. Has to be\ndone, though.\n"},"templates/special.html":{"url":"templates/special.html","title":"Template types","keywords":"","body":"1. Template specialization1.1. Of filter1.2. Struct and Class filters1.3. Implement filter1.4. Variadic templates1.4.1. Recursive variadic template1. Template specialization\nWe have seen in the last chapter, the declaration of template symbol,\nthat can be instanciated using any types. Sometimes, it can be usefull\nto restrict the set of types that can be used in a given template\nsymbol (e.g. only slices but of any type, only classes, only\nstructures, etc.). In order to make this possible, the Ymir language\noffers some elements to filter the different types that can be used.\nThe following code block present the complete syntax of a template\nparameter.\ntemplate_parameter := Identifier | of_filter | class_filter | struct_filter | impl_filter | variadic_filter\n\nof_filter := Identifier 'of' type\nclass_filter := 'class' Identifier\nstruct_filter := 'struct' Identifier\nimpl_filter := Identifier impl type\nvariadic_filter := Identifier '...'\n\n\nOne can note that every template parameters have an Identifier. This\nidentifier are the root of the specialization tree. For example, in\nthe following template parameters {T of [U], U} there are two\nroots, T and U. The root U is important, these\ntemplate parameters are different to {T of [U]}. In the first\ncase, the identifier U refers to a template type (as it is a\nroot of the parameters), and in the second case it refers directly to\na type that is named U, and that has to be declared somewhere.\n1.1. Of filter\nThe of filter is declared using the keyword of. This filter is\nused to specify the form of the type that can be used to instanciate\nthe template. The form can be any form of type, it can be for example\na slice, an array, a template symbol, etc. In the following example,\nthe first function foo declared at line 6, is a template\nfunction that can be instanciated using only T=i32. The second\nfunction foo at line 14 use the of filter to inform\nthat the type T must have the same form as the type Z, but\ndoes not filter the type Z. The third function foo at line\n21, accepts for the type T any slice that have as internal\ntype a template type declared as Z, there is no filter on\nZ.\nimport std::io;\n\n/**\n * This function will only be callable, with a i32 as T\n */\ndef foo {T of i32} (_ : T) {\n    println (\"First ??\");\n}\n\n/**\n * This function will only be callable, with a type that fit the Z pattern\n * That is to say every type\n */\ndef foo {T of Z, Z} (_ : T) {\n    println (\"Second ?\");\n}\n\n/**\n * This function will be only callable, with a slice of Z, where Z can be anything\n */\ndef foo {T of [Z], Z} (_ : T) {\n    println (\"Third !\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ([1, 2]);\n}\n\n\nIn the above example, one can note that, two functions can be called\nby the expression foo ([1, 2]). The second and third ones. The\ntemplate definition that match the best the types, will be used. Here,\nthis is the third one, the filter is more specific and thus has a\nbetter score.\nResults: \nThird !\n\nThe of filter is a kind of destructuring pattern. They can be\nchained, and composed with other filters. Here some other example,\nwhere this time the of filter is used to get the template types\nparameters of a given class type, and apply some filter on them.\nimport std::io;\n\n/** A template class, that takes any type as template parameters */\nclass X {T} {\n    let _x : T;\n\n    pub self (x : T) with _x = x {}\n}\n\n/**\n * This function accepts any X object, as long as its template parameter is a slice\n */\ndef foo {T of &(X!{U}), U of [Z], Z} (x : T) {\n    println (\"Slice X : \", x::typeinfo.name);\n}\n\n/**\n * Accept all the X objects, that have not been accepted by the first function\n * Indeed, the template is less specific, and is used only if the first one fails\n */\ndef foo {T of &(X!{U}), U} (x : T) {\n    println (\"Not a slice X : \", x::typeinfo.name);\n}\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = X::new ([1, 2, 3]);\n    let b = X::new (\"Test\");\n    let c = X::new (23.0f);\n\n    foo (a);\n    foo (b);\n    foo (c);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nSlice X : main::X([i32])::X\nSlice X : main::X([c32])::X\nNot a slice X : main::X(f32)::X\n\nAs presented in the introduction of this chapter, there is a\ndifference between identifier that can be found in the roots of the\ntemplate parameters and those which are not. In the following example,\nthe foo function accept a slice of U where U is not\ndefined, resulting in an error by the compiler. Indeed, the type\nU could have been defined somewhere, and there must be a\ndistinction between this type and a template parameter.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {T of [U]} (a : T) {}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ([1, 2]);\n}\n\n\nErrors: \nError : the call operator is not defined for foo {T of [U]}(a : T)-> void and {mut [mut i32]}\n --> main.yr:(6,6)\n 6  ┃     foo ([1, 2]);\n    ╋         ^      ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate foo --> main.yr:(3,5) : foo {T of [U]}(a : T)-> void\n    ┃     ┃ Error : undefined type U\n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(3,16)\n    ┃     ┃  3  ┃ def foo {T of [U]} (a : T) {}\n    ┃     ┃     ╋                ^\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.2. Struct and Class filters\nThe keywords struct and class defines respecitvely the struct\nand class filters. They filter the accepted types of a template\nsymbol. Unlike of filter they cannot be chained, and accept only an\nidentifier. In the following example, the first foo function at\nline 11 is instanciable using a class type, and the second at\nline 15 only accept struct types. Warning class filter\naccepts a reference class type, and not directly the class type\n(&A not A).\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n-> X;\n\nclass A {\n    self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo {class T} () {\n    println (\"Class !\");\n}\n\ndef foo {struct T} () {\n    println (\"Struct !\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!(&A) ();\n    foo!(X) ();\n}\n\n\nResults:\nClass !\nStruct !\n\nEven if this filters cannot be chained, they can be used as the leaf\nof a of filter. In the following example, the function foo\naccepts a slice of class objects.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass A {\n    pub self () {}\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\nclass B {\n    pub self () {}\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\ndef foo {T of [U], class U} (a : T) {\n    println (T::typeid, \" = \", a, \"\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ([A::new (), A::new ()]);\n    foo ([B::new ()]);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n[&(main::A)] = [main::A(), main::A()]\n[&(main::B)] = [main::B()]\n1.3. Implement filter\nWe have seen in the chapter about traits\n(cf. Traits),\nthat class type can implement a given trait. Implementing a trait\ngives specific method to a class type, that can be called. However\ntraits lose most of their interest if it is impossible to accept a\ntype that implements the trait without knowning the type itself. This\ncannot be done by inheritance, as traits are not types, however\ntemplates have a specific filter to perform this operation. In the\nfollowing example, the impl filter is used by the foo\nfunction, that thus accepts any kind of object as long as they impl\nthe trait Getter.\nimport std::io;\n\ntrait Getter {\n    pub def get (self)-> i32;\n}\n\nclass A {\n\n    pub self () {}\n\n    impl Getter {\n        pub over get (self)-> i32 {\n            12\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef foo {T impl Getter} (a : T) -> i32 {\n    a.get ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new ();\n    println (foo (a));\n}\n\n\nA trait can be a template symbol. In that case it has some template\nparameters, that can be destructured by a template filter. For\nexample, in the following source code, the trait Getter is a\ntemplate, that is implemented using the type i32 by the class\nA. The first foo function at line 1 accepts any kind\nof object as long as they impl the trait Getter, and filter the\ntemplate parameter of this trait to get it under the identifier\nX. The second foo function only accepts types that\nimplements the trait but using a slice. Because the second foo\nfunction is more specific when using &B object, it is called at\nline 44.\nimport std::io;\n\ntrait Getter {T} {\n    pub def get (self)-> T;\n}\n\nclass A {\n\n    pub self () {}\n\n    impl Getter!{i32} {\n        pub over get (self)-> i32 {\n            12\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass B {\n\n    pub self () {}\n\n    impl Getter!{[i32]} {\n        pub over get (self)-> [i32] {\n            [12, 24]\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndef foo {T impl Getter!{X}, X} (a : T) -> X {\n    print (\"First : \");\n    a.get ()\n}\n\ndef foo {T impl Getter!{X}, X of [U], U} (a : T)-> X {\n    print (\"Second : \");\n    a.get ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new ();\n    let b = B::new ();\n\n    println (foo (a));\n    println (foo (b));\n}\n\n\nResults: \nFirst : 12\nSecond : [12, 24]\n\n1.4. Variadic templates\nVariadic templates are special templates, that takes an arbitrary\nnumber of type as arguments. They are defined using an identifier\nfollowed by the token .... When the specialization is done, the\nidentifier of the variadic template, can be used to define a tuple\ntype. In the following example, the type of the parameter a of\nthe foo function is (i32, i32, i32, i32, i32). Warning\nIf only one type is given to the variadic template, then it is not a\ntuple, but directly the type that has been given. As you may have\nguessed by now, the println function is a variadic template\nfunction.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo {T ...} (a : T) {\n    println (a.0, expand a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n112345\n\nThe identifier can also be used to complete another type. For example,\na function pointer type. In the following source code, the structure\nX accepts an arbitrary number of type as template parameters,\nand use them to form the type of the field foo. When\ninstanciated by the main function at line 12, the field\nfoo takes the type fn (i32, f32)-> void.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| foo : fn (T)-> void\n -> X {T...};\n\ndef foo (x : i32, y : f32)-> void {\n    println (\"(\", x, \", \", y, \")\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = X!{i32, f32} (&foo);\n    x.foo (12, 3.14f);\n}\n\n\nResults: \n(12, 3.140000)\n\nTo force the type to be a tuple inside another type, the standard\nsyntax of tuple can be used. For example, the field foo could\nhave been defined as follows fn ((T,))-> void, in that case it\nwould have been equal to fn ((i32, f32))-> void, meaning a\nfunction pointer that takes a parameter of type (i32, f32), and\nreturns nothing.\n1.4.1. Recursive variadic template\nVariadic template must contain at least one type. To perfom recursive\nvariadic function, end case functions must be written, this end case\ngenerally contains a standard template parameter. For example, the\nfollowing example presents a foo function that takes variadic\nparameters, and prints them. The end case is described at line\n3, where the function takes only one standard template\nparameter. The function foo at line 8 takes two template\nparameter, a standard one that will be used for the first parameter of\nthe function, and a variadic one for the rest of the parameters. One\ncan note from the line 5 that even if the type of b is\nc8 and thus not a tuple, the keyword expand is usable, and\ndoes nothing particular.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {F, R...} (a : F, b : R) {\n    println (\"FST : \", F::typeid, \"(\", a, \")\");\n    foo (expand b);\n}\n\ndef foo {F} (a : F) {\n    println (\"SCD : \", F::typeid, \"(\", a, \")\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (1, 3.f, \"Test\", 'r'c8);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nFST : i32(1)\nFST : f32(3.000000)\nFST : [c32](Test)\nSCD : c8(r)\n"},"templates/cte.html":{"url":"templates/cte.html","title":"Template values","keywords":"","body":"1. Template values1.1. Compilation time values1.2. Values as template parameter1.2.1. Template literal1.2.2. Template variable1.2.3. Template type for template variable1.3. Function pointers1. Template values\nIn Ymir, templates are seen as compilation time execution\nparameters. These parameters can be either types or values. When\ndealing with values, as with any values, decisions and program\nbranching can be made, but because these values are known at\ncompilation time, the decisions can also be made at compilation\ntime. This system is called compilation time execution or cte for\nshort. The keyword cte is used to ensure that a part of the code\nis executed at compilation time, and generates a value (that can be\nvoid) at compilation as well, to save time at execution time and\nhave a better optimized executable.\n1.1. Compilation time values\nBasically, every values can be known at compilation time as long as\nthey do not implies variable, or dynamic branching. For example, the\nvalue of the foo function in the following source code can be\nknwon at compilation time. Indeed, it implies only constants, that can\nbe computed by the compiler directly. The main function uses the\nkeyword cte to force the compiler to call the function foo\nduring the compilation. If the keyword is omitted then the function\nfoo is called at execution time.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo () -> i32 {\n    bar () + baz ()\n}\n\ndef bar () -> i32 \n    12\n\ndef baz () -> i32\n    30\n\ndef main () {\n    let z = cte foo ();\n    println (z);\n}\n\n To verify that the compilation time execution effectively\nhappened, the option -fdump-tree-gimple can be used. This option\ncreates alternative files, that give information about the\ncompilation, and can be used to see what the frontend of the Ymir\ncompiler gave to the gcc compiler (source code close the C\nlanguage). The following block of code presents a part of the content\nof this file. One can note that the main function does not call\nthe foo function, but only the println function with the\nvalue 42.\nmain ()\n{\n  {\n    signed int z;\n\n    z = 42;\n    _Y3std2io11printlnNi327printlnFi32Zv (z);\n  }\n}\n1.2. Values as template parameter\nWe have seen in the previous chapter that templates parameters are\nused to accept types. They also can be used to accept values, in that\ncase the syntax - described in the following code block - is a bit\ndifferent. The syntax for template values is close to variable\ndeclaration, using the token :, or by using directly the literal\nthat is accepted.\ntemplate_value := literal | Identifier ':' (Identifier | type) ('=' literal)?\n\n1.2.1. Template literal\nA literal that can be known at compilation time can be used to make a\ntemplate specialization. The types that can be knwon at compilation\ntime are the following :\n\nstring ([c8] or [c32])\nchar (c8 or c32)\ninteger (signed or unsigned)\nfloat\n\nContribution: tuple, and struct are not compilation time knowable,\nbut this seems possible if they only contains cte values, same for\nslice that are not strings.\nIn the following example, there are three different definition of the\nfunction foo. The first one at line 3 can be called using\na the cte value 3, the second one at line 8 using the\nvalue 2, and so on. The main function calls the function\nfoo using the value 5 - 2, so the first definition at line\n3 is used.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {3} () {\n    println (\"3\");\n    foo!2 ();\n}\n\ndef foo {2} () {\n    println (\"2\");\n    foo!1 ();\n}\n\ndef foo {1} () {\n    println (\"1\");\n    foo!0 ();\n}\n\ndef foo {0} () {\n    println (\"Go !\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!{5 - 2} ();\n}\n\n\nResults: \n3\n2\n1\nGo !\n\nLiteral string can also be used as template parameter. We will see in\na forthcoming chapter that those are used for operator overloading\n(cf. Operator\noverloading). A\nsimple example is presented in the following source code, where the\nfoo function accepts the literal Hi I'm foo !, and is called\nby the main function using different ways.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {\"Hi I'm foo !\"} () {\n    println (\"Yes that's true !\");\n}\n\ndef bar () -> [c32] {\n    \"I'm foo !\"\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!\"Hi I'm foo !\" ();\n    foo!{\"Hi \" ~ bar ()} (); \n}\n\n\nResults: \nYes that's true !\nYes that's true !\n1.2.2. Template variable\nBecause it would be utterly exhausting to write every definitions of\nthe template function with every possible literals (and even\nimpossible when dealing with infinite types such as slice), we\nintroduced the possibilty of writing template variables. Unlike real\nvariables those are evaluated at compilation time, and can be defined\nonly inside template parameters. The definition syntax of template\nvariable is close to the definition of a standard parameter, with the\ndifference that the type can be a template type (containing root\nidentifiers, foundable inside the template parameters). The following\nexample presents the definition of a function that make a countdown to\n0 (the generalization of the function foo presented in the\nfirst example of the previous section).

Template type for template variable\nThe type of a cte variable can be a template. In that case the used\ntemplate identifiers must be roots of the template parameters (exactly\nthe same behavior as the of filter). In the following example, the\nfunction foo takes a value as template parameter, the type of\nthis value can be anything as long as it can be known at compile time.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {N : T, T} () {\n    println (T::typeid, \"(\", N, \")\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!42 ();\n    foo!\"Hi !\" ();\n}\n\n\nResults: \ni32(42)\n[c32](Hi !)\n Compilation time values, can also be used to get the size of a\nstatic array at compilation time, and make a template function that\naccepts arrays of any size. This evidently works only on static\narrays, and not on slice, because the size of the array has to be\nknwon at compilation time. However, this would not be necessary when\nusing slice, because function accepting slice as parameter already\naccepts slices of any size.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo {ARRAY of [T; N], T, N : usize} (a : ARRAY) {\n    println (\"Got an array of \", T::typeid, \" of size : \", N);\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let array = [0; 10u64];\n    foo (array);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nGot an array of i32 of size : 10\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n1.3. Function pointers\nLambda functions and function pointers can be compile time knwon\nvalues. This is not the case for closure, and method delegates. Unlike\nfunction pointers, template function are statically written in the\ngenerated executable, thus more efficient (even if we are talking of\nmarginal gain). To accept a function pointer, a template variable must\nbe defined in the template parameters. In the following example, the\nfunction foo accepts a function pointer, that takes two\nparameters, and return a value of the same type of the\nparameters. This type seems to be unknown and is not inferable from\nthe lambda function that is passed to the function at line 13,\nbut is infered from the execution time parameters passed to the\nfunction. At line 14, one can note that a standard function can\nbe used as a template variable.\nimport std::io;\n\n\ndef foo {F : fn (X, X)-> X, X} (a : X, b : X) {\n    println (\"Foo : \", F (a, b));\n}\n\ndef bar (a : i32, b : i32) -> i32 {\n    a * b\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!{|x, y| => x + y} (11, 31);\n    foo!bar (6, 7);\n}\n\n\nResults\nFoo : 42\nFoo : 42\n In the following example, the function pointer this time return a\ndifferent type from the type of the parameters it takes. This function\nfoo applies this function pointer to all element of the slice it\ntakes as parameters.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {F : fn (X)-> Y, X, Y} (a : [X]) {\n    for i in a {\n        println (\"Foo : \", F (i));\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!{|x| => cast!i64 (x) + 12i64} ([1, 2, 3]);\n}\n\n\nResults:\nFoo : 13\nFoo : 14\nFoo : 15\n"},"templates/values.html":{"url":"templates/values.html","title":"Compilation time execution","keywords":"","body":"1.

Template values\nIn the previous chapter, we saw that some values can be known at the\ntime of compilation. These values can be used for the compiler to\ndecide which part of the code should be compiled and which part should\nnot, using branching operations.\n1.1. Compile time condition\nThe keyword cte is used to inform the compiler that a value can\nbe known at compile time, and must be evaluated during the\ncompilation. It is not the default behavior of the compiler, as the\ncompilation would be extremely long, if every values had to be\nchecked. This keyword can be used on if expression to execute the\ncondition at compile time, and evaluate compile only a part of the\nsource code. In the following example, an if expression is used to\ncheck if the template value that is passed to the foo function\nwas lower than 10. Because it is the case only the scope of the\nif expression is compiled (not the scope of the else), that is why\neven if the scope of the else part has no sense in term of types,\nthe compiler does not return any error.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {X : i32} () {\n    cte if X \n\nResults: \nX is  As normal if expression, cte if expression can be chained,\nhowever the keyword cte must be repeated before each if expression\notherwise the compiler consideres that they are execution time if\nexpression.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo {X : i32} () {\n    cte if X  25 : \", X);\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!{2} ();\n    foo!{14} ();\n    foo!{38} ();\n}\n\n\nX is  25 : 38\n1.2.

This way, even if the class was not disposed\nby hand, it is disposed when the garbage collector destroy the\ninstance. (Warning to avoid multiple disposing the method\ndispose shoud verify that the object is not already disposed,\ne.g. the method can be called twice by hand, or first by hand, and\nthen by the destructor).\n"},"traits/hashable.html":{"url":"traits/hashable.html","title":"Hashable","keywords":"","body":"1.

Simple operator overloading\nThis chapter presents the standard operator overloading : unary, binary and comparison.\n1.1. Unary operator\nUnary operators are operators that are applied to only one\noperand. The overloading of the operator is made by defining a\ntemplate method inside the class definition. The name of the template\nmethod must be opUnary, and must take a template value as first\nargument. The table bellow lists the rewrite operations that are done\nby the compiler to call the correct template method for operator\noverloading.\n\n\n\nexpression\nrewrite\n\n\n\n\n-e\ne.opUnary!(\"-\")\n\n\n*e\ne.opUnary!(\"*\")\n\n\n!e\ne.opUnary!(\"!\")\n\n\n\nIn the following example, the class A has two opUnary\nmethods. The first one at line 8, is applicable with the operator\n-, and the second one at line 12 is applicable with any\nother operators. \nimport std::io;\n\nclass A  {\n    let _a : f32;\n\n    pub self (a : f32) with _a = a {} \n\n    pub def opUnary {\"-\"} (self) -> &A {\n        A::new (-self._a)\n    }\n\n    pub def opUnary {op : [c32]} (self) -> &A {\n        cte if (op == \"!\") // op is compile time known\n            A::new (1.f / self._a)\n        else // operator '+'\n            self\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new (10.0f);\n    println (!a); \n}\n\n\nThis example, call the method defined at line 12 by using the\noperator !. In this method the value of op is known at\ncompile time, and thus can be compared (also at compile time). The\n! unary operator is defined for the class A as giving the\ninverse of the value stored in the object, thus the result is the\nfollowing :\nmain::A(0.10000)\n1.2. Binary operator\nBinary operators are also overloadable. As for unary operators, the\noverloading of binary operators is made by code rewritting at compile\ntime. In the case of binary operators, the operation involves two\ndifferent operands, one of them must be an object instance. \nThe following operators are overloadable. The use indicated in the\nleft column is only an indication and corresponds to the common use of\nthese operators, but they can of course be used for other purposes.\n\n\n\nMath\n+\n-\n*\n/\n%\n^^\n\n\n\nBitwise\n|\n&\n^\n \n >> \n\n\n\nArray\n~\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>` |    `~` | `&`  | -->\nThe following example presents a class A that overload the\noperator + and - using a i32 as a second operand.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass A {\n    let _a : i32;\n\n    pub self (a : i32) with _a = a {}\n\n    pub def opBinary {\"+\"} (self, a : i32) -> &A {\n        A::new (self._a + a)\n    }\n\n    pub def opBinary {\"-\"} (self, a : i32) -> &A {\n        A::new (self._a - a)\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new (12);\n    println (a - 30);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nmain::A(-18)\n\nBecause there are two operands (sometimes of different types), binary\noperation can sometimes be not commutative (for example the math\nbinary operator -). To resolve that problem the rewritting is\nmade in two different steps, the first step tries to rewritte the\noperation using the method opBinary, if this first rewritte\nfailed a second rewritte is made, but this time using the right\noperand and by calling the method opBinaryRight. If the right\noperator is not defined, the compiler does not try to make the\noperation commutative, the two methods must be defined.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass A {\n    let _a : i32;\n\n    pub self (a : i32) with _a = a {}\n\n    pub def opBinaryRight {\"-\"} (self, a : i32) -> &A {\n        A::new (a - self._a)\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new (12);\n    println (54 - a);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nmain::A(42)\n1.3. Limitations\nFor the moment, templates method cannot be overriden by children\nclasses. For that reason, it is impossible to override the behavior of\nthe binary operator of an ancestor class. The limitation is the same\nfor unary operators. However, to allow such behavior, the overloading\nmethod can call a standard method (without template), that is\noverridable by a children class. An example is presented in the\nfollowing source code.\nimport std::io\n\nclass A {\n\n    let _i : i32;\n    pub self (i : i32) with _i = i {}\n\n    pub def opBinary {\"+\"} (self, i : i32) -> &A {\n        self.add (i)\n    }\n\n    pub def add (self, i : i32)-> &A {\n        A::new (i + self._i)\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\nclass B over A {\n    pub self (i : i32) with super (i) {}\n\n    pub over add (self, i : i32)-> &A {\n        B::new (i * self._i)\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let mi = B::new (8);\n    println (mi + 8);\n}\n\nContribution How to override template method is currently under\ndiscussion ! But it seems impossible for many reasons that are not\ndiscussed here, you can contact us for more information.\n1.4. Comparison operators\n The equality and comparison are treated via two different methods\nopEquals and opCmp. Because while almost all types can be compared\nfor equality, only some have meaningful order comparison.\nThe opCmp method is used for the operators , >,  and >=\nonly. And the method opEquals is used for the operator == and\n!=. When the method opEquals is not defined for the type, the\ncompiler will try to use the method opCmp instead. When both the\nmethods are defined, it is up to the user to ensure that these two\nfunctions are consistent.\nIndeed, it is impossible to verify that in a general case. For example\nthe operator  can be used on a set object, where the operator\nx  stand for x is a strict subset of y. Therefore, even if\nneither x  and y  are true, the equality x == y is not\nimplied.\n1.4.1. Overloading == and !=\nThe method opEquals is a simple method, that does not take\ntemplate arguments. Expressions of the form a != b, are rewritten\ninto !(a == b), therefore there is only one method to define.\nimport std::io\n\nclass Point {\n\n    let x : i32, y : i32;\n\n    pub self (x : i32, y : i32) with x = x, y = y {}\n\n    pub def opEquals (self, other : &Point) -> bool {\n        self.x == other.x && self.y == other.y\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws &AssertError \n{\n    let a = Point::new (1, 2);\n    let b = Point::new (2, 3);\n    let c = Point::new (1, 2);\n    assert (a == c);\n    assert (a != b);\n}\n\n\nThe operator opEquals is assumed commutative, thus when the\noperator is only defined for the type on the right operand, the\noperation will simply be rewritten reversely. The following example\npresents such a case, where the operator opEquals is only\ndefined by the class A. The line 19 is simple rewritten into\nmi.opEquals (8).\nimport std::io\n\nclass MyInt {\n\n    let i : i32;\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with i = i {}\n\n    pub def opEquals (self, i : i32) -> bool {\n    self.i == i\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let mi = MyInt::new (8);\n    assert (8 == mi);\n}\n\n1.4.2. Overloading , =\nThe method opCmp is used to compare an object to another\nvalue. The comparison unlike equality evaluation, gives a comparison\norder between two values. The method opCmp does not take any\ntemplate parameter, but returns an integer value. A negative value\nmeaning that the left operand is lower than the right operand, an\npositive value, that the left operand is higher than the right one,\nand a nul value that both operands are equals.\nThe following table lists the possible rewritting of the comparison\noperators. As we can see in this table, the operator is assumed to be\nnot commutative, thus if the first rewritting fails to compile (for\ntype reason), then the second rewritting is used.\n\n\n\ncomparison\nrewrite 1\nrewrite 2\n\n\n\n\na \na.opCmp (b) \nb.opCmp (a) > 0\n\n\na > b\na.opCmp (b) > 0\nb.opCmp (a) \n\n\na \na.opCmp (b) \nb.opCmp (a) >= 0\n\n\na >= b\na.opCmp (b) >= 0\nb.opCmp (a) >= 0\n\n\n\nIn the following example, a comparison operator is used at line\n19, the rewritting (7).opCmp (mi)  does not compile,\nbecause 7 is not an object value, and thus does not have any\nmethod. The second rewritting is thus used, mi.opCmp (7) > 0.\nimport std::io\n\nclass MyInt {\n\n    let i : i32;\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with i = i {}\n\n    pub def opCmp (self, i : i32) -> i32 {\n        self.i - i\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let mi = MyInt::new (8);\n    assert (7 \n1.5. Assignment\nThe assignment operator is not overloadable, it will always perform\nthe same operation. However, the shortcut operators +=, -=,\n*= etc, are usable on object when oveloading the binary\noperator. This operation is simply rewritten at compilation time, for\nexample the expression a += 12 is rewritten into a =\na.opBinary!{\"+\"}(12). The following example presents an utilisation\nexample of the += shortcut.\nimport std::io\n\nclass MyInt {\n\n    let _i : i32;\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with _i = i {}\n\n    pub def opBinary {\"+\"} (self, a : i32)-> &MyInt {\n        MyInt::new (self._i + a)\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut mi = MyInt::new (8);\n    mi += 9;\n    println (mi);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nmain::MyInt(17)\n\nOne can note that the instance of the object stored in the variable\nmi is changed after the affectation. This is the standard\nbehavior of the = operator.\n"},"templates/complex_operators.html":{"url":"templates/complex_operators.html","title":"Access, contains and iteration","keywords":"","body":"1. Set operators1.1. Access operator1.2. Contains operator1.3. Iteration operator1. Set operators\nIn this chapter are presented the operators related to set object. The\noperators are : access, contains and iteration operators.\n1.1. Access operator\nThe operator of index [] is overloadable by the method\nopIndex. This method is called with the parameters passed inside of\nthe brackets of the index operator. For example, the following\noperation a [b, c, d] is rewritten into a.opIndex (b, c, d).\nimport std::io\n\nclass A {\n    let dmut i : [i32];\n\n    pub self (a : [i32]) with i = copy a {}\n\n    pub def opIndex (self, x : i32) -> i32 \n        throws &OutOfArray\n    {\n        self.i [x]\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray, &AssertError\n{\n    let i = A::new ([1, 2, 3]);\n    assert (i [2] == 3);\n}\n\n \nOne can note from the above example, that the object stored in i\nis immutable, and that the opIndex is always a right operand. It\nis possible to modify the values inside the i object (if it is\nmutable) using the opIndexAssign method. This method rewritte\nthe assignement operation where the left operand is an access\noperation. The following example presents an example of usage of this\nmethod.\nimport std::io\n\nclass A {\n    let dmut i : [i32];\n\n    pub self (a : [i32]) with i = copy a {}\n\n    pub def opIndex (self, x : i32) -> i32 \n        throws &OutOfArray\n    {\n        self.i [x]\n    }\n\n    pub def opIndexAssign (mut self, x : i32, z : i32)\n        throws &OutOfArray\n    {\n        self.i [x] = z;\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray, &AssertError\n{\n    let dmut i = A::new ([1, 2, 3]);\n\n    (alias i) [2] = 9; // alias is important, otherwise the method is not callable\n    println (i);\n\n    assert (i [2] == 9);\n}\n\n\nResults: \nmain::A([1, 2, 9])\n1.2. Contains operator\nThe contain operator is a binary operator used to check if an element\nis inside another one. This operator is defined using the keyword\nin. Unlike other operator, the rewritte for the overloading is made\nonly once on the right operand, and call the method opContains, for\nexample the expression a in b is rewritten into b.opContains\n(a). The expression a !in b will be rewritten into !(a in b).\nclass A {\n\n    let _a : [i32];\n\n    pub self (a : [i32]) with _a = a {}\n\n    pub def opContains (self, i : i32)-> bool {\n    for j in self._a {\n        if (i == j) return true;\n    }\n    false\n    }    \n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let i = A::new ([1, 2, 3]);\n    assert (2 in i);\n    assert (9 !in i);\n}\n\n1.3. Iteration operator\nObject can be iterated using a for loop. As for any operators, the\nfor loop used on object is rewritten at compilation time. There are\nmultiple methods to write when writting an iterable class. The\nfollowing source code present an example of a for loop, and the\nsource code underneath it present its rewritten equivalent.\nlet a = A::new ();\nfor i, j in a {\n    println (i, \" \", j);\n}\n\n\nlet a = A::new ();\n{\n    let dmut iter = a.begin ();\n    while !iter.opEquals (a.end ()) {\n        let i = iter.get!{0} ();\n        let j = iter.get!{1} ();\n        {\n            println (i, \" \", j);\n        }\n        iter:.next ();\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn this example, two elements can be highlighted: 1) the iter\nvariable, that stores an iterator object, 2) the begin and\nend method of the class A. Indeed, an iterable object is\nan object that contains two methods begin and end, that\nreturns an mutable iterator pointing respectivelly to the beginning\nand to the end of the iterable set.\nThe iterator type is a type defined by the user, and that contains the\nopEquals method, a method next on a mutable instance, and\nthe method get, template method thats returns value pointed by\nthe current iteration.\nThe following example presents the implementation of a Range\nthat has the same behavior as a r!i32 with a step 1 and a\nnot including the end value.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass Range {\n    let _fst : i32;\n    let _lst : i32;\n\n    pub self (fst : i32, lst : i32) with _fst = fst, _lst = lst {}\n\n    pub def begin (self)-> dmut &Iterator { // must return a dmut value\n        Iterator::new (self._fst)\n    }\n\n    pub def end (self)-> &Iterator {\n        Iterator::new (self._lst)\n    }\n\n    impl Streamable;\n}\n\nclass Iterator {\n    let mut _curr : i32;\n\n    pub self (curr : i32) with _curr = curr {}\n\n    pub def get {0} (self) -> i32 {\n        self._curr\n    }\n\n    pub def opEquals (self, o : &Iterator) -> bool {\n        self._curr == o._curr\n    }\n\n    pub def next (mut self) {\n        self._curr += 1;\n    }\n}\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut r = Range::new (0, 10);\n    for i in r {\n        println (i);\n    }\n}\n\n\nTo be more efficient and avoid a new allocation at each iteration, the\nend method should return a value that is computed once.\nContribution Enhance this section, which is completely\nunclear. And add information about error handling maybe.\n"},"version/":{"url":"version/","title":"Version","keywords":"","body":"1. Version1.1. Debug version1.2. Predefined versions1. Version\nVersion is another conditional compilation process (in addition to\ncompile time execution with templates), that select parts of the\ncode that must be compiled or not.

Warning the identifier of the version\nis not case sensitive, thus Demo and DEMO are\nidentical. The version are activated by the command line using the\noption -fversion. In the following example the version\nDemo, and Full are used.\nimport std::io;\n\n__version Demo {\n    def foo () {\n        println (\"Foo of the demo version\");\n    }\n} else {\n    __version Full {\n        def foo () {\n            println (\"Foo of the full version\");\n        }\n    }    \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\n\n$ gyc main.yr -fversion=Demo\n$ ./a.out\nFoo of the demo version\n\n$ gyc main.yr -fversion=Full\n$ ./a.out\nFoo of the full version\n\n\nTo use multiple version, the option must be set for each version. \n$ gyc main.yr -fversion=Demo -fversion=Full\n\n1.1. Debug version\nThe debug option of the command line -g activates the\nDebug version even without the option -fversion.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo () {\n    __version DEBUG {\n        println (\"Entering foo\");\n    }\n\n    println (\"foo\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\n\n$ gyc main.yr -g\n$ ./a.out\nEntering foo\nfoo\n\n$ gyc main.yr\n$ ./a.out\nfoo\n\n1.2.
