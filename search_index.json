Introduction2. Important2.1. Installation2.1.1. Native installation2.1.2. Uninstallation of the native version2.2. Docker installation1. Introduction\nYmir is a high-level, statically typed programming language\n  designed to help developers save time by providing type safety with\n  strong and secure semantics. The semantics of this language is\n  oriented towards security, concurrency and speed of execution. These\n  objectives are achieved thanks to its high expressiveness and its\n  direct compilation into an efficient native machine language.\nThis documentation explores the main concepts of Ymir, providing a\nset of examples that demonstrate the strengths of this new\nlanguage. It will also present an introduction to the standard\nlibrary.\n2. Important\nBefore starting to discuss the language, please keep in mind that it\nis still under development and that sometimes things may not work as\nexpected. If you encounter errors that you do not understand or think\nare incorrect, please contact us at: gnu.ymir@mail.com. We look\nforward to receiving your mails!\n2.1. Installation\nThe reference compiler of Ymir is based on the compiler GCC,\nwhich offer strong static optimization, as well as a vast set of\nsupported target architectures.\nThere are two ways to install the gyc (Gnu Ymir Compiler), natively or by using a docker container.\n2.1.1. Native installation\nThis compiler can be installed on linux debian system, by following those simple steps: \n\nFirst, you need to downloads the packages : \n\nlibmidgard-9-dev\nGYC\n\n\nAnd then, you need to install them using dpkg : \n\n\n$ sudo dpkg -i libgmidgard_9.3.0_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i gyc-9_9.3.0_amd64.deb\n\nThese packages depend on : \n\ng++-9\ngcc-9-base\nlibc6 >= 2.21\nlibgmp10 >= 2:5.0.1~\nlibmpc3\nlibmpfr6 >= 3.1.3\nzlib1g >= 1:1.1.4\nlibgcc1\nzlib1g-dev\nzlib1g >= 1:1.2.0\nlibgc-dev >= 1:7.4.2\n\nIf one of them is not installed, you will get an error, that can be resolved by running the following command : \nsudo apt --fix-broken install\n\nAnd then reinstall the package that has previously failed (dpkg).\nThe compiler is now installed and is named gyc\n$ gyc --version\n\ngyc-9 (GCC) 9.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n2.1.2. Uninstallation of the native version\nAs for any debian package, the uninstall is done as follows : \n$ dpkg -r gyc-9\n$ dpkg -r libgmidgard-9-dev\n\nCaution The uninstallation can remove your gcc installation.\nBut you can still reinstall it easily if there is any problem, by typing : \nsudo apt install --reinstall gcc-9\n\n2.2. Docker installation\nTo start you have to install docker.\n$ sudo apt install docker.io\n\nThen retrieve the docker image from the repository :\n$ docker pull gnuymir/9.3.0-amd64\n\nThe compiler is now accessible via the container.\n$ docker run -t -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp gnuymir/9.3.0-amd64 --version \ngyc-9 (GCC) 9.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

Variables and Mutability1.1. Global variables1.2. Shadowing and scope1.2.1. Shadowing1.2.2. Lifetime1. Variables and Mutability\nVariables are declared with the keyword let, the type of the\nvariable is deduced from the value associated with it. The type of the\nvariable can be forced with the : token, but it must be\ncompatible with the value.\nIf a variable is declared immutable, once a value is bound to it, it\ncan no longer change. In addition, a variable must have an initial\nvalue and cannot be declared without it, in order to garanty that a\nvariable is always initialized. You will see in the Control\nflow\nsection, that a variable can still be intialized conditionnaly.\nThe following source code present a declaration of a variable x,\nof type i32.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 2;    \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x);\n}\n\nThe compiler should return the following error: \nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(7,2)\n    ┃ \n 7  ┃     x = 3; \n    ┃     ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\nIn Ymir, variable mutability and, type mutability ensure, through\nstatic checks, that when one declares that the value of a variable\nwill not change, it will really never change. Although this can\nsometimes be a little frustrating for the user.\nA variable is immutable by default, but it can sometimes be useful to\nmake it mutable. To do this, you can use the keywords mut and\ndmut.  Mutability applies to types, not just variables. The\ndifference between these two keywords is that dmut means that\nthe type of the variable is deeply mutable. The immutability of a type\nis transitive, but this transitivity and what it implies will be\nexplained in detail in another chapter, since it is an advanced\nknowledge of the language Ymir (cf. Alias and\nReferences).\nIf we take the same example as above, except that we add the keyword\nmut to the declaration of the variable x.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = 2;    \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x);\n}\n\n\nThis time the compiler will not return any errors, and the next output should appear\nwhen running the program.\nX is equal to : 2\nX is equal to : 3\n\nVariable mutability can be very useful, but sometimes a little\ndifficult to address when dealing with complex types. The Ymir\nlanguage has aliasable types, that borrows data from different\nsegment of memory, with strong mutability semantics. Those types are\nexplained in detail in the chapter Aliases and\nreferences.\n1.1. Global variables\nGlobal variables are variables that are declared outside of a\nfunction, they can be used for multiple reasons. These types of\nvariables are declared using the keyword static.\nAs with all variables, these may or may not be mutable, but are\nimmutable by default.\nimport std::io\n\nstatic pi = 3.14159265359\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Pi value is : \", pi);\n}\n\n1.2. Shadowing and scope\n1.2.1. Shadowing\nAll variables that are not global, have a life time that is defined by\ntheir scope. A scope is a code segment, which has a beginning and an\nend, in which statements are made. Further information on scope will\nbe provided in the chapter on function bodies in\nFunctions.\nTwo variables with the same name cannot be declared in colliding\nscopes, i.e. if a variable is declared with the name of a currently\nliving variable in the current scope, a shadowing error will occur.\nThe following source code illustrates this point, where two variable\nare declared in the same scope with the same name x.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 9;\n\n    let x = 12;\n}\n\n\nWith this source code the compiler will return the following error.\nError : declaration of x shadows another declaration\n --> main.yr:(6,6)\n    ┃ \n 6  ┃     let x = 12;\n    ┃         ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(4,6)\n    ┃     ┃ \n    ┃  4  ┃     let x = 9;\n    ┃     ┃         ^\n    ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\nUnlike some other programming languages, the shadowing of a variable\nis also not permitted in sub scopes, thus the following source code\nshould also return an error.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 9;\n    { // entering a scope\n    let x = 12; \n    }   \n}\n\n1.2.2. Lifetime\nAs explained earlier the lifetime of a variable is the lifetime of the\nscope in which a variable was declared. For example, compiling the\nfollowing source code will return an error, as the variable x no\nlonger exists when trying to print it.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    {\n    let x = 12;\n    } // x does not exists past this scope end\n    println (x);\n}\n\n\nIf a variable is declared inside a scope and is never used during its\nlifetime the compiler will return an error. To avoid this error, the\nvariable can be named _. This seems useless to declare a\nvariable that is not used, but it can be useful sometimes (for example\nwhen declaring function parameters in a overriden function, cf. Class\ninheritence).\nA variable, whose name is _ is anonymus, then there is no way to\nretreive the value of this variable.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let _ = 12; // declare a anonymus variable\n}\n\n"},"primitives/types.html":{"url":"primitives/types.html","title":"Data types","keywords":"","body":"1.

Static Arrays1.2.5. Option1. Primitives types\nIn Ymir language, each value has a certain type of data, which\nindicates how the program must behave and how it should operate with\nthe value. Ymir is a statically typed language, which means that\nall types of all values must be known at compile time. Usually, the\ncompiler is able to deduce the data types from the values, and it is\nnot necessary to specify them when declaring a variable. But\nsometimes, when it comes to the mutability of a variable or the\ninheritance of a class, for example, the inference can be wrong and\nthe behavior not adapted to what you might want to do.\nTherefore, the type may be added when declaring a variable, as in the\nfollowing code.\nlet mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2];\nlet mut y = [1, 2];\n\n\nTo understand the difference between the type of x and the type\nof y, we invite you to read the chapter\nAliases and References.\nEach type has type attributes, which can be accessed by using the ::\noperator on a type.\nlet a = i32::init;  // i32 (0)\n\n\nAll primitive types have common attributes that are listed in the\ntable below:\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value of the type\n\n\ntypeid\nThe name of the type stored in a value of type [c32]\n\n\n\n1.1. Scalar types\nScalar types represent all types containing a single value. Ymir\nhas five primitive scalar types: integers, floating point, characters,\nbooleans, and pointers. They can have different sizes for different\npurposes.\n1.1.1. Integer types\nAn integer is a number without decimal points. There are different\ntypes of integers in Ymir, the signed one and the unsigned\none. Signed and unsigned refers to the possibility for a number to be\nnegative. Signed integer types begin with the letter i, while\nunsigned integers begin with the letter u. The following table\nlists all the different types of integers, and sorts them by memory\nsize.\n\n\n\nsize\nsigned\nunsigned\n\n\n\n\n8 bits\ni8\nu8\n\n\n16 bits\ni16\nu16\n\n\n32 bits\ni32\nu32\n\n\n64 bits\ni64\nu64\n\n\narch\nisize\nusize\n\n\n\nThe usize and isize types are architecture dependent, and have the\nsize of a pointer.\nEach type of signed integer can store values ranging from -(2\nn - 1) to 2 n - 1 - 1, where n is the size\nof the integer in memory. Unsigned types, on the other hand, can store\nnumbers ranging from 0 to 2 n - 1. For example, type\ni8, can store values from -128 to 127, and type u8 can\nstore values from 0 to 255.\nYou can write an integer in two forms, decimal 9_234 and hexadecimal\n0x897A. The _ token, is simply ignored in a literal integer.\nTo make sure the literal has the type you want, you will need to add\nthe type as a prefix to the literal. For example, to get a i8\nwith the value 7, you would write 7i8. By default, if no prefix is\nadded at the end of the literal, its type is considered a i32.\nAs indicated above, each type has attributes, the following table\nlists the integer-specific attributes:\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nmax\nThe maximal value\n\n\nmin\nThe minimal value\n\n\n\nAn overflow check is performed on literals, and an error is returned\nby the compiler if the type of integer you chose is not large enough\nto contain the value. For example:\ndef main () {\n    let x : i8 = 934i8;\n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : overflow capacity for type i8 = 943\n --> main.yr:(12,18)\n    ┃ \n12  ┃     let x : i8 = 943i8;\n    ┃                  ^^^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\nWARNING However, if the value cannot be known at compile time, the\noverflow is not checked and can lead to strange behavior. For example,\nif you try to add 1 to a variable of type i16 that contains the\nvalue 32767, the result will be -32768.\n1.1.2. Floating-point types\nFloating-point types, refer to the number having a decimal\npart. Ymir provides two types of floating point numbers, f32\nand f64, which have a size of 32 bits and 64 bits respectively.\nYou can add the prefix f, at the end of a literal floating point\nto specify that you want a f32, instead of a f64 as it is\nby default.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 1.0; \n    let y : f32 = 1.0f;\n}\n\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to floating point\ntypes.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value - nan\n\n\nmax\nThe maximal finite value that this type can encode\n\n\nmin\nThe minimal finite value that this type can encode\n\n\nnan\nThe value Not a Number\n\n\ndig\nThe number of decimal digit of precision\n\n\ninf\nThe value positive infinity\n\n\nepsilon\nThe smallest increment to the value 1\n\n\nmant_dig\nNumber of bits in the  mantissa\n\n\nmax_10_exp\nmaximum int value such that 10max_10_exp10^{max\\_10\\_exp}10​max_10_exp​​ is representable\n\n\nmax_exp\nmaximum int value such that 2max_exp−12^{max\\_exp-1}2​max_exp−1​​ is representable\n\n\nmin_10_exp\nminimum int value such that 10min_10_exp10^{min\\_10\\_exp}10​min_10_exp​​ is representable as a normalized value\n\n\nmin_exp\nminimum int value such that 2min_exp−12^{min\\_exp-1}2​min_exp−1​​ is representable as a normalized value\n\n\n\n1.1.3. Boolean type\nA boolean is a very simple type that can take two values, either true or false.  For example:\ndef main () {\n    let b = true;\n    let f : bool = false;\n}\n\n\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to boolean type.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value - false\n\n\n\n1.1.4. Character type\nThe c8 and c32 are the types used to encode the\ncharacters.  As with literal integers, it is necessary to add a prefix\nto define the type of a literal. The prefix used to specify the type\nof a literal character is c8, if nothing is specified, the\ncharacter type will be c32.\nThe c32 character has a size of four bytes and can store any\nunicode value.  Literal characters can have two forms, and are always\nsurrounded by the ' token. The first form is the character\nitself, and the second is the unicode value in the integer\nform \\u{12} or \\u{0xB}.\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺';    \n    let y = '\\u{0x263A}';\n}\n\nIf the loaded literal is too long to be stored in the character type,\nan error will be returned by the compiler. For example :\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺'c8; \n}\n\nThe error should be as follows, and this means that you will need at\nleast 3 c8 to store the value, so it doesn't fit into one\nc8 :\nError : malformed literal, number of c8 is 3\n --> main.yr:(2,10)\n    | \n 2  |     let x = '☺'c8; \n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to char types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value - \\u{0}\n\n\n\n1.1.5. Pointers\nPointer are values that stores an address of memory. They can be used\nto store the location of a data in memory. In Ymir, pointers are\nconsidered low level programming and are mainly used in the std, and\nruntime to interface with machine level semantics. You can perfectly\nwrite any program without needing pointers.\nPointers are defined using the & keyword on types, or on\nvalues. They are aliasable types, as they borrow memory (cf Aliasable\nand\nReferences).\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &SegFault, &AssertError\n{\n    let mut i = 12;\n    let p : &i32 = &i; // creation of a pointer on i\n    i = 42;\n    assert (*p == 42); // dereference the pointer and access the value\n}\n\n\nPointers are unsafe, and dereference a pointer can result in undefined\nbehavior depending on where it points. It can also sometimes raise a\nsegmentation fault. In Ymir, segmentation fault are recovered,\nand an exception is thrown. Error handling is presented in chaper\nError\nHandling.\nWARNING, Note that the segmentation fault may not occur even if\n  the pointer is not properly set. The easiest way to avoid undefined\n  behavior is to not use pointers and use std verified functions, or\n  other semantically verified elements (cf Aliasable and\n  References).\n\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to char types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninner\nThe type of the inner value - for example : i32 for &i32\n\n\n\n1.2. Compound types\nUnlike scalar types, the compound contains multiple values.  There are\nthree types of compounds: the tuple, the range and the arrays.\n1.2.1. Tuple\nA tuple is a set of values of different types. Tuples have a fixed\narity, once it has been defined at compile time, it cannot be\nmodified. Each element of a tuple has a type, and its order cannot be\nchanged either. Tuples are built between parentheses, by a\ncomma-separated list of values.\ndef main () {\n    let t : (i32, c32, f64) = (1, 'r', 3.14); \n}\n\n\nThe tuple t, is a single element, and can be passed as a function\nparameter or as a return value of a function. It can also be\ndestructured, in order to retrieve the values of its component\nelements. There are three ways to do this, the first one is to use the\ndot operator ., and an integer whose value is known at\ncompilation time.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let z : i32 = t._0;\n    let y : c32 = t. (0 + 1); \n    println (t.2);\n}\n\n\nThe other method is to use the tuple destructuring syntax, which will\ncreate new variables and therefore starts with the keyword let.\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let (x, y, z) = t;\n\n    let (f, e...) = t;\n    println (f, \" \", e.0);\n}\n\n\nIn the last example, we can see that the tuple destructuring syntax\nallows to extract only a part of the tuple values. The value of\ne in this example will be ('r', 3.14).\nThe last method to extract values from the tuple is with the keyword\nexpand, this keyword is a compile-time rewrite and the following\nexample shows how you can use it.\nimport std::io\n\ndef add (a : i32, b : i32) -> i32 \n    a + b\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (1, 2);\n    println (add (expand x)); \n\n    // Will be rewritten into :     \n    println (add (x.0, x.1));\n\n    // rewritter into : (1, x.0, x.1)\n    let j : (i32, i32, i32) = (1, expand x);    \n}\n\n\nWe will see in the Control flows section, a fourth and a fifth\nmethod to extract values from tuple.\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to tuple types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\narity\nThe number of elements contained in the tuple\n\n\ninit\na tuple, where each element values are set to init\n\n\n\n1.2.2. Ranges\nRanges are types that contain two values defining a range, and are\nnamed r!(T), where T is the type of the range limits. They\nare created by the token .. or .... A range consists of\nfour values, which are stored in the fields shown in the following\ntable. These fields can be accessed using the . token, as unlike\ntype specific attributes, they are not knwon at compile time, and must\nbe accessed dynamically.\n\n\n\nname\ntype\nvalue\n\n\n\n\nfst\nT\nthe first bound\n\n\nscd\nT\nthe second bound\n\n\nstep\nmut T\nthe step of the interval\n\n\ncontain\nbool\nIs the scd bound contained in the interval\n\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let range : r!(i32) = 1 .. 8;     \n    let c_range : r!(i32) = 1 ... 8;\n}\n\nThe step_by function takes a range as a parameter and returns a\nnew range, with a modified step.\ndef main () { \n    let range = (1 .. 8).step_by (2); \n}\n\nThe Control flows section shows a use of these types.\nThe range types have no specific attributes accessible with the\n:: token.\n1.2.3. Arrays\nAn array is a collection of values of the same type, stored in\ncontiguous memory.  Unlike tuples, the size of an array is unknown at\ncompile time, and in Ymir, they are similar to slices, and will be\nrefered as such.\nA slice is a two-word object, the first word is the length of the\nslice, and the second is a pointer to the data stored in the slice. A\nslice is an aliasable type, its mutability is a bit more complicated\nthan the mutability of scalar types, because it borrows memory which\nis not automatically copied when an assignment is made. This section\nwill not discuss the mutability of internal types or aliasable types,\nso we recommend you read the Aliases and\nReferences\nchapter.\nThe field len records the length of the slice and can be\nretrieved by the point operator ..  The length of the slice is\nstored in a usize field.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n   let x = [1, 2, 3];\n   println (\"The value of x : \", x); \n   println (\"The length of x : \", x.len);\n}\n\nSimilarly, the ptr field, gives access to the pointer of the\nslice and its types depend on the inner type of the slice, and is\nnever mutable. Pointer type are absolutely not important for a\nYmir program, and we suspect that you will never have use of\nthem. But they are defined just in case.\nTo access the elements of an array, the [] operator is used. It\nwill take either an integer value or a range value. If a range value\nis given, a second slice that borrows a section of the first is\ncreated. For now, the range step does not affect the borrowing of the\narray.\nimport std::io\ndef main () \n    throws OutOfArray \n{\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let y = x [0..2];\n    let z = x [0];\n\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z); \n}\n\nAccess to a slice is not secure, and may fail at runtime. This is why\nthe main function in the above example throws the OutOfArray\nexception. The exception system is detailed in the Error Handling\nchapter.\nThe \"~\" operator is used to concatenate two arrays of the same\ntype. We did not use the + operator as in many languages, because it\ncreates ambiguities. For example, the following line `\"string: 1 +\n2\", is unclear, maybe the user wanted to add 1 and 2 and then\nmake the concatenation , but the result will be \"string : 12\".\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> [i32] {\n    [8, 7, 6]\n}\n\ndef main ()  {\n    println ([1, 2, 3] ~ foo ());\n}\n\nYou can also create a new table using the allocation syntax. This will\nallow you to allocate a new array in the heap, with an initial value\nfor each index in the slice. The size may be unknown at compile time.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = [0 ; new 100u64]; \n    println (a);\n}\n\n1.2.4. Static Arrays\nUnlike the slice, static arrays are stored on the stack rather than in\nthe heap, and their size is known at compile time. They are\ninstantiated with a syntax close to the slice allocation syntax, but\nomitting the new keywork.\nimport std::io\n\n/**\n  * Takes an array of size twelve as parameter\n  */\ndef foo (a : [i32 ; 12]) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws OutOfArray\n{\n    let mut a : [mut i32 ; 12] = [0 ; 12];\n\n    for i in 0 .. 12\n        a [i] = i\n\n    let b = [1; 12];\n\n    foo (a);\n    foo (b);\n}\n\nYou can transform a static array into a slice using the alias,\ncopy and dcopy keywords. The chapter Aliases and references\nexplains the difference between these keywords.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = [0; 12];\n\n    let a = alias x;\n    let b = copy x;\n\n    println (a, \" \", b);\n}\n\n1.2.5. Option\nThe option typed values are values that may be set or not. They are\ndefined using the token ? on types or values. Further\ninformation on option type are given in Error\nhandling\nchapter.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let i : i32? = (12)?;\n    let j : i32? = (i32)?::err;     \n}\n\n"},"primitives/functions.html":{"url":"primitives/functions.html","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"1.

If a parameter\nhas a value, the value is used by default, so it is optional to\nspecify the value when calling the function for that particular\nparameter. If you still want to specify a value, you will need to use\na named expression that is formed using the -> token.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (x : i32 = 8) {\n    println (\"The value of x is : \", x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n    foo (x-> 7);\n}\n\nThe named expression can also be used for parameters that do not have\na default value. A named expression will allow you to specify the\nparameter in any order you want. The algorithm, which determines which\nparameter an argument refers to, is presented bellow and we will\nillustrate it by the following example :\ndef foo (x : i32, y : i32 = 9, z : i32) {\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (8, y-> 1, x-> 2);\n}\n\nThe algorithm is the following : \nLet args be the list of arguments ([y-> 1, x-> 2, 8])\nLet params be the list of parameters (x, y=9, z)\nLet final_args = [], be the list of final arguments\nfor each p in params :\n    for a in args :\n        if p.name == a.name : \n            final_args = final_args ~ [a]\n            remove p in params\n            remove a in args\n            found = true\n            break\n    if not found : \n        final_args = final_args ~ firstUnamedArg (args)\n        remove p in params\n        remove firstUnamedArg (args) in args\n\nIn this example, the result of each step will be : \n1, x : [x-> 2]\n2, y : [x-> 2, y-> 1]\n3, z : [x-> 2, y-> 1, 8]\nYou can use a complex expression for the default expression of a\nparameter, such as the creation of a class, a function call, and even\na code block. However, you cannot refer to the other parameters of the\nfunction. In the next section, we will talk about function bodies, but\nthe explanations presented there are valid for any type of expression.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (x : i32) -> i32 \n    x + 1\n\ndef bar (x : i32) -> i32\n    x + 2\n\ndef test (a : i32, b : i32 = {bar (1) + foo (2)}) {\n    //                             ^\n    //                       Try to replace by a\n    println (a);\n    println (b);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    test (12);\n}\n\n1.2. Function body\nThe body of a function is an expression. Everything in ymir is an\nexpression, but each expression does not always have a value, and can\nbe empty. An empty expression has the type void.\nA simple add function can be written as follows: \ndef add (x : i32, y : i32)-> i32 \n    x + y\n\nOr by using a more complex expression, such as block, which is an\nexpression containing a set of statements. A block is surrounded by\nthe {} tokens, and the last expression in a block is its value.\ndef main () {\n    let x = {\n        let y = 9;\n        y + 1\n    }\n}\n\nThe ; token is a way of specifying that an expression ends, and that\nthe value of the block is the expression that follows. If no\nexpression follows the expression, the block value is evaluated to\nnothing and its type is void. For example, if we write the\nfollowing code :\ndef foo () -> i32 \n    9\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = {\n        foo ();\n    }\n}\n\nYou should get the following error from the compiler : \nError : cannot declare var of type void\n --> main.yr:(6,9)\n    | \n 6  |     let x = {\n    |         ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n1.3. Function return type\nSometimes a function can return a value, the type of the value must be\ndefined at the end of the function definition before the value, using\nthe token ->. The type of the value of the function must be the\nsame as the one defined in the prototype.\ndef foo (x : i32)-> i32 \n    x + 1\n\ndef bar (x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 {\n    let z = x + y;\n    println (\"The value of z : \", z);\n    foo (z)\n}\n\nThe keyword return is used to end a function prematurely.\ndef isDivisable (x : i32, z : i32) -> bool {\n    if (z == 0) return false;\n\n    (x % z) == 0\n}\n\nIf the type of the value of the function body is not equivalent to the\ntype of the function, and if it is possible that the function may\nnever encounter a return declaration, an error is returned by the\ncompiler. For example, with the following code :\nimport std::io\n\ndef add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    x + 1;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = add_one (5);\n    println (\"The value of x : \", x);\n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : incompatible types i32 and void\n --> main.yr:(3,29)\n    | \n 3  | def add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    |                             ^\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(5,1)\n    | \n 5  | }\n    | ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nBut if you change the last expression by a return statement, for example : \nimport std::io\n\ndef add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    if (x == 12) {\n        return x + 1\n    } else {\n        return x + 2\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = add_one (5);\n    println (\"The value of x : \", x);\n}\n\nThe compiler won't return any error.\n1.4. Block declaration\nYou can declare functions, structures, and so on in a function. This\nmakes it possible to create symbols that are only useful for the\ncurrent function. Subfunctions do not cover the scope of the parent\nfunction.\ndef foo () {\n    import std::io;    \n    let x = 12;\n\n    def bar () -> i32 {\n        // Try to add the following line \n        // println (x);\n        12\n    }\n    println (x + bar ());\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n\n    // Try to add the following lines : \n    // bar ();\n    // println (\"In the main function !\");\n}\n\nThere is no way to retrieve the bar symbol outside the foo\nfunction. The function is not a module Cf. Modules\n1.5. Uniform call syntax\nYou can also call a function using uniform call syntax, by placing the\nfirst parameter of the function on the left. This syntax is used to\nperform continuous data processing and to make the source code easier\nto read.\nimport std::io\n\ndef plusOne (i : i32) -> i32 \n    i + 1\n\ndef plusTwo (i : i32) -> i32\n    i + 2\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 12;\n    x.plusOne ()\n     .plusTwo ()\n     .println ();\n}\n\n"},"primitives/control.html":{"url":"primitives/control.html","title":"Control flows","keywords":"","body":"1.

Control flows\nWhen writing a program, the ability to decide to execute part of the\ncode conditionally, or to repeat part of the code, is a basic scheme\nthat can be really useful.\nIn Ymir, unlike many C languages, there is no statement,\neverything is an expression and can be evaluated. Thus, you can\ninitialize a variable with an expression if, while or even for.\n2. If expression\nAn if expression allows you to branch into your code by making\ndecisions based on conditions. An if expression consists of a keyword\nif, followed by an expression that must be typed as a bool,\nfollowed by an expression. You can add an else after an if\nexpression, to execute the code, if the condition of the if\nexpression is not met.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 5;\n\n    if x \nYou can add an every expression you want after an else, for example another if.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 5;\n    if x \nAs mentioned above, since everything is an expression, you can use if\nexpressions as values. Each branch of the if expression must have\nthe same type, otherwise an error will be returned by the\ncompiler. The value of an if, can of course be of type void.\ndef main () {\n    let condition = true;\n    let x = if condition {\n        5 \n    } else {\n        7\n    };\n}\n\nIf no else follows an if expression, a default else that does\nnothing and has an empty value is added. For example, with the\nfollowing code :\ndef main () {\n    let condition = true;\n    let x = if condition {\n        5 \n    };\n}\n\nYou should get the following error: \nError : incompatible types void and i32\n --> main.yr:(3,10)\n    | \n 3  |     let x = if condition {\n    |             ^^\n    | Note : \n    |  --> main.yr:(4,3)\n    |     | \n    |  4  |         5 \n    |     |         ^\n    |------------------------------ \n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n2.1. Loops\nIn Ymir, there is three kind of loops: loop, while and for.\n2.1.1. Infinite repetitions with loop\nThe keyword loop is used to specify that a block of code must be\nrepeated endlessly.\ndef main () {\n    loop {\n        println (\"I will be printed an infinite number of times\");\n    }\n}\n\nA loop can be used to repeat an action until it succeeds, e.g. waiting\nfor the end of a thread, or waiting for incoming network connections,\netc.  The keyword break is used to stop a loop and gives it a value.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut counter = 0;\n\n    let result = loop {\n        counter += 1;\n        if counter == 10 {\n            break counter + 1;\n        }\n    };\n    println (\"Result : \", result);\n}\n\nThe above source code will produce the following result:\nResult : 11\n2.1.2. Loop while condition is met\nThe keyword while creates a loop, which continues until a condition\nis no longer satisfied. As for the loop, it can be broken with the\nkeyword break. The value of a while is given by the value of its\ncontent expression, at the last iteration, or by the value given by a\nbreak if it has been broken.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut i = 0;\n    let x = while i \nThe above source code will produce the following result:\nX is : 10\n2.1.3. For loops to iterate over a value\nThe last type of loop is the for loop. It is applicable on an\niterable type. The value of a for loop works exactly like the\nevaluation of the value of a while loop. Ranges, Slice and Tuple are\niterable types.  For example, for range :\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    for i in (0 .. 8).step_by (2) {\n        println (i);\n    }    \n\n    for i in 10 .. 0 {\n        println (i, \"!\");\n    }\n}\n\nYou can iterate a slice by value, by defining a single iterator on the\nfor loop. This variable, will make a copy of each element of the\nslice, at each iteration. Of course, you can choose to iterate by\nreference, and even make it mutable. Or get the index at the same\ntime. When using an index, its type is a usize.\n\nIteration by value :\n\nfor i in [1, 2, 3]\n\n\nIteration by reference : \n\nlet mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2, 3];\nfor ref mut i in x {\n    i = 8;\n}\nprintln (x);\n\n\nIteration by value and index, (the value can of course be a reference) : \n\nfor index, value in [1, 2, 3]\n\nIf the slice you are iterating on is mutable, you can have mutable\naccess to its values.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n    for ref mut i in x {\n        if i % 2 == 0 {\n            i = 8;\n        }\n    }\n    println (x);\n}\n\nThe mutability of the tables and the reference system are advanced\nknowledge of the language, and will not be discussed in this\nchapter. For more information, please read the chapter on\nAliases and references.\nYou can also iterate over tuple, but it will be a static iteration,\nand is equivalent to a static rewrite.\nimport std::io \n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (1, 'r');\n    for i in x {\n        println (i);\n    }\n\n    // Is equivalent to \n    println (x.0);\n    println (x.1);\n}\n\n"},"advanced/":{"url":"advanced/","title":"Alias and References","keywords":"","body":"1. Alias and References1.1. Standard and Aliasable types1.2. Mutability level1.2.1. Deep mutability1.2.2. String literal1.3. Memory borrowing1. Alias and References\nThe alias and reference is one of the most important characteristics\nof the Ymir language, which allows it to give guarantees on the\nmutability of the data, and the explicit movement of the memory. It is\nimportant to understand how memory works in Ymir, in order to\nunderstand the error message you might get when you try to move data\nfrom one variable to another.\nIt is important to understand that Ymir is a high level\nprogramming language, and that you will never have to worry about\nmemory management (memory leaks). However, in terms of mutability and\naccess rights, the language provides an expressive system for managing\nmemory movements.\n1.1. Standard and Aliasable types\nIn Ymir, there are two types, standard types and aliasable\ntypes. A value whose type is a standard type, can be copied without\nexplicitly informing the compiler. The standard types are all\nprimitive types, except the slices. On the other hand, aliasable types\nare types that have borrowed data, which will not be copied unless it\nis explicitly written into the code, to avoid performance loss.\nTo understand how data is represented in a program, you need to know\nthe difference between heap and stack. The stack is a space allocated\nby the program when a function is entered, which is released when the\nfunction is exited. On the other hand, the heap is a space that is\nallocated when certain instructions in the program require it, such as\ncreating a new table, creating a new object instance, and so on.\nWhen an array is created, all its data is stored in the heap, and the\naddress of this data is stored in the stack, where the variables are\nlocated. The following figure shows the data representation for this\nprogram:\ndef foo () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n}\n\n\n1.2. Mutability level\nWe define the level of mutability as the deepest level of the type\nthat is mutable. An example of a mutability level is shown in the\nfollowing table:\n\n\n\nType\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nmut [i32]\n1\n\n\n[i32]\n0\n\n\nmut [mut i32]\n2\n\n\ndmut [[[i32]]]\n4\n\n\n\nThis is mainly used to ensure that the borrowed data is not changed by\nanother variable in a foreign part of the program. The user has full\ncontrol over the data he or she has created. The example below shows\nhow the mutability level is used to ensure that the content of a\ntable is never changed.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    x = [2, 3, 4];\n    // Try to add the following line : \n    // x [0] = 8;\n}\n\nThe type of x in the previous example is mut [i32], we didn't\nspecify mutability for the internal part of the array, so the compiler\nassumed you didn't want it to be mutable, for security reasons. If you\ndid the previous exercise, you should get the following error:\nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(7,7)\n    | \n 7  |     x [0] = 8;\n    |       ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nThis means that the data borrowed by x (and in this case are\nlocated in the heap) are not mutable.\n1.2.1. Deep mutability\nEarlier we introduced the keyword dmut, this keyword is used to\navoid a very verbose type statement, and to say that every subtype\nfrom this point on will be mutable. This keyword is applicable to all\ntypes, but will only have a different effect from mut on arrays and\ntuples. The following table gives an example of an array type, using\nthe keyword dmut :\n\n\n\nType\nVerbose equivalent\n\n\n\n\ndmut [i32]\nmut [mut i32]\n\n\ndmut [[[i32]]]\nmut [mut [mut [mut i32]]]\n\n\n\nIf we modify the example given above, and change the mut keyword to\na dmut keyword, the type of x becomes mut [mut i32], so x[0] = 8\nbecomes a valid statement.\n1.2.2. String literal\nLiteral strings, unlike literal arrays, are found in the text\n(read-only part of a program). This means that the type of a literal\nstring is [c32] (or [c8] if the suffix s8 is specified), while\nthe type of a literal array (of i32 for example) is mut\n[mut i32]. So, if you write the following code:\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut x = \"Try to make me mutable !?\";\n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : discard the constant qualifier is prohibited, left operand mutability level is 2 but must be at most 1\n --> main.yr:(4,14)\n    | \n 4  |     let dmut x = \"Try to make me mutable !?\";\n    |              ^\n    | Note : \n    |  --> main.yr:(4,18)\n    |     | \n    |  4  |     let dmut x = \"Try to make me mutable !?\";\n    |     |                  ^\n    |------------------------------ \n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n1.3. Memory borrowing\nWhen you want to make a copy of a value whose type is aliasable, you\nmust tell the compiler how you want to make the copy. There are four\nways to move or reference memory, which are provided with the\nfour keywords ref, alias, copy and dcopy.\n"},"advanced/references.html":{"url":"advanced/references.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"1.

Reference as a value\nA reference is not a type, it is only a kind of variable, you cannot\nstore references in subtypes (for example, you cannot make a reference\narray, or a tuple containing a reference to a value). This means that\nwith the following code, you should get an error.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 12;\n    let y = (10, ref x);\n}\n\nWarning : the creation of ref has no effect on left operand\n --> main.yr:(3,19)\n    | \n 3  |     let y = (10, ref x);\n    |                      ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nThis warning means that you have used the keyword ref but the\ncompiler will ignore it because it will not create a reference to x\nin the value of y.\n1.3.

For\nexample, the compiler must return an error on the following code.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let mut y : [mut i32] = alias x;\n    //                      ^^^^^\n    // Try to remove the alias\n    println (y);\n}\n\nError : discard the constant qualifier is prohibited, left operand mutability level is 2 but must be at most 1\n --> main.yr:(5,13)\n    | \n 5  |     let mut y : [mut i32] = alias x;\n    |             ^\n    | Note : \n    |  --> main.yr:(5,29)\n    |     | \n    |  5  |     let mut y : [mut i32] = alias x;\n    |     |                             ^^^^^\n    |------------------------------ \n\nError : undefined symbol y\n --> main.yr:(8,14)\n    | \n 8  |     println (y);\n    |              ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nHowever, if the variable that will borrow the data is not mutable,\nthere is no need to add the keyword alias, and the compiler will\ncreate an implicit alias, which will have no consequences.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let y = x; \n    println (y);\n}\n\nIn the last example, y can be mutable, as long as its internal\nvalue is immutable, i.e. its type is mut [i32], you can change the\nvalue of y, but not the value it borrows. There is no problem, the\nvalues of x will not be changed, no matter what you do with y.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let mut y = x; \n    // y [0] = 9;\n    // Try to add the above line \n\n    y = [7, 8, 9];\n    println (y);\n}\n\nYou may have noticed that even though the literal is actually the\nelement that creates the data, we do not consider it to be the owner\nof the data, so the keyword alias is implied when it is literal. We\nconsider the data to have an owner only once it has been assigned to a\nvariable.\nThere are other kinds of alias that are implicitly allowed, such\nas code blocks or function returns. Those are implicit because\nthe alias is already made within the value of these elements.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> dmut [i32] {\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    alias x // alias is done here and mandatory\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (); // no need to alias\n    println (x); // [1, 2, 3];\n}\n\n1.1. Alias a function parameter\nAs you have noticed, the keyword alias, unlike the keyword ref,\ndoes not characterize a variable. The type of a variable will indicate\nwhether the type should be passed by alias or not, so there is no\nchange in the definition of the function. When the type of a parameter\nis an aliasable type, this parameter can be mutable without being a\nreference.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (mut x : [mut i32]) {\n    x [0] = x [1];\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    foo (alias x);\n    //   ^^^^^\n    // Try to remove the alias\n}\n\nAs with the variable, if the function parameter cannot affect the\nvalues that are borrowed, the alias keyword is not required.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (x : [i32]) {\n    println (x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    foo (x);\n}\n\n1.2. Special case of struct and tuple\nIn the chapter Structure you will learn how to create a structure\ncontaining several fields of different types. You have already learned\nhow to make tuples. These types are sometimes aliasable, depending on\nthe internal type they have. If a tuple, or a structure, has a field\nwhose type is aliasable, then the tuple or structure is also\naliasable.\nThe table bellow present some example of aliasable tuple : \n\n\n\nType\nAliasable\n\n\n\n\n(i32, i32)\nfalse\n\n\n([i32],)\ntrue\n\n\n([i32], f64)\ntrue\n\n\n(([i32], i32), f64)\ntrue\n\n\n\n"},"advanced/copies.html":{"url":"advanced/copies.html","title":"Copy and Deep copy","keywords":"","body":"1.

The following table shows some examples of copy types:\n\n\n\nType\nType of copied value\n\n\n\n\n[i32]\nmut [mut i32]\n\n\nmut [i32]\nmut [mut i32]\n\n\nmut [[i32]]\nmut [mut [i32]]\n\n\n\nAn example of what you can achieve with copy is shown in the\nfollowing code.

Deep copy\nThe deep copy will make a copy of the value and all internal values,\nit must be used in special cases because it is much less efficient\nthan the simple copy, which copies only one level of the data. There\nis nothing complex to understand in deep copy, it simply creates a\nvalue, deeply mutable, which is an exact copy.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = [[1], [2, 3], [4]];\n    let dmut y = dcopy x;\n    let mut z : [mut [i32]] = copy x;\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z);\n}\n\n"},"types/":{"url":"types/","title":"User define types","keywords":"","body":"1.

Memory borrowing of structure1.3. Default value1.4. Packed and Union1. Structure\nStructure is a common design used in many languages to define users'\ncustom types, which contains multiple values of different\ntypes. Structures are similar to tuples, in terms of memory management\n(always located in the stack). Unlike tuples, structures have a name,\nand all their internal fields also have a name.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n| y : i32 \n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let point = Point (1, 2);\n    println (point);\n}\n\nAs you can see structure are printable.\n1.1. Structure mutability\nThe mutability of a field of a structure is defined in the structure\ndeclaration. As with any variable declaration, the fields of a\nstructure are by default immutable. You can of course add the keyword\nmut before the declaration of the field, to make it mutable. Its\nmutability therefore depends on the mutability of the variable that\nborrows the data from the structure.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n| mut y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut point = Point (1, 2);\n    //  ^^^\n    // Try to remove the mut here\n    point.y = 98;\n\n    // Try to add the following line \n    // point.x = 34;\n\n    println (point);\n}\n\n1.2. Memory borrowing of structure\nAs explained in the chapter Alias, structures are only aliasable\nif they contain a field whose type is aliasable. All the fields of a\nstructure are copied each time an assignment is made.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| mut x : i32\n| mut y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let p = Point (1, 2);\n    let mut p2 = x;\n    p2.y = 12; \n    println (p, \" \", p2);\n}\n\nThe above program should compile and display the following output : \nmain::Point(1, 2) main::Point(1, 12)\n1.3. Default value\nYou can add a default value for a field in a structure, such as a\nfunction call, it can be changed when creating a new structure, using\na named expression, which is constructed with the -> token.\nThe algorithm for determining which field an argument is associated\nwith is the same as that used for the function call, and is presented\nin Function.\nExercise : Try to guess the output of the following program : \nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32 = 0\n| y : i32 \n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let point = Point (y-> 12, x-> 98);\n    println (point);\n\n    let point2 = Point (1);\n    println (point2);\n}\n\n Correction (spoiler) : \n\nmain::Point(98, 12)\nmain::Point(0, 1)\n\n\n1.4. Packed and Union\nThis part only concerns advanced programming paradigms, and is close\nto the machine level. I don't think you'll ever need it, unless you\ntry to optimize your code at a binary level.\nThe size of a structure is calculated by the compiler, which decides\nthe alignment of the different fields. This is why the size of a\nstructure containing an i64' and ac8'is16bytes, not9bytes. To force the compiler to remove the optimized alignment, you\ncan use thepacked` modifier.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct @packed\n| x : i64\n| c : c8\n -> Packed;\n\nstruct \n| x : i64\n| c : c8\n -> Unpacked;\n\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Size of packed : \", sizeof Packed);\n    println (\"Size of unpacked : \", sizeof Unpacked);\n}\n\nSize of packed : 9\nSize of unpacked : 16\nThe union modifier, on the other hand, tells the compiler that all\nfields in the structure must share the same memory location. The size\nof the structure will then be the size of its largest field.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct @union\n| x : i32\n| y : f32\n -> Dummy;\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = Dummy (y-> 12.0f);\n    println (x.x);\n}\n\n1094713344\nAs you can see, the construction of the Union requires only one\nargument. You cannot give several arguments when building a union, as\nthey would be contradictory. The argument must also be passed as a\nnamed expression (using the -> token).\n"},"types/enum.html":{"url":"types/enum.html","title":"Enum","keywords":"","body":"1. Enumeration1.

Modules1.1. File hierarchy1.2. Privacy1.3. Sub modules1.4. Symbol conflict resolution1.5. Public importation1.6. Include directory1.7. Compilation of modules1. Modules\nWhen creating a large project, it is very important to organize your\ncode. Ymir offers a system of modules, which is used to manage\ndifferent parts of the code that have different purposes. Each source\nfile in Ymir is a module.\n1.1. File hierarchy\nLet have a look at the following file hierarchy : \n.\n├── main.yr\n└── sub_modules\n    ├── bar.yr\n    └── foo.yr\n\n1 directory, 3 files\nIn this hierarchy we have three files, which contain modules, the\nfirst module in the file main.yr will be named main. The second\none in the sub_modules/bar.yr file will be named sub_modules::bar,\nand the third one in the sub_modules/foo.yr file will be named\nsub_modules::foo.\nTo be properly importable, the module must be defined from the\nrelative path of the compilation, i.e. if the file is located in\n$(pwd)/relative/path/to/file, its module name must be\nrelative::path::to::file.\nThe name of a module is defined by the first line of the source code,\nby keyword mod. If this line is not given by the user, the\npath of the module will only be the file name, so you will not always\nbe able to import the module, depending on its relative path.\nFor example, in the file foo.yr, the first line must look like : \nmod sub_modules::foo\n\nAnd, it will therefore be importable everywhere, for example in the\nmain module, when writing the import declaration :\nimport sub_modules::foo\n\n1.2. Privacy\nAll symbols defined in a module are private by default. Only modules\nthat have declared the symbol have access to it. With the keyword\npub you can export the symbol for an external modules, which will then\nhave access to the symbol.\nFor example, with file foo.yr filled as follows : \nmod sub_modules::foo;\n\npub def foo () {}\n\ndef bar () {}\n\nAnd the file main.yr as follows : \nimport sub_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n//  ^^^\n// Try to replace foo by bar\n}\n\nThe main module, will only have access to the foo function, which\nis declared in the sub_modules::foo module. The keyword pub can be\nused as a block to cover multiple declarations :\nmod sub_modules::foo\n\npub {\n    def foo () {}\n\n    def bar () {}\n}\n\n1.3. Sub modules\nIt is possible to declare sub-module that are part of a global module,\nwith the keyword mod. Unlike global modules, you have to name them\nwhen you want to access the symbols declared inside them. For example :\nmod main\nimport std::io\n\nmod InnerModule {\n    pub def foo () {\n        println (\"Foo\");\n        bar ();\n    }\n\n    def bar () {\n        println (\"Bar\");\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    InnerModule::foo ();\n    //           ^^^\n    // Try to replace by bar\n}\n\nThe confidentiality system is the same as for the global module. A\nmodule is a symbol, so its privacy is the same as the privacy of\nfunctions, structure, class, etc. Only the main module will have\naccess to the sub-module InnerModule in the example above.\n1.4. Symbol conflict resolution\nWhen two external global modules declare two symbols with the same name,\nit may be impossible to know which symbol you want to use. In this\ncase, you can use the full name of the symbol to resolve the\nambiguity. For example, with the bar.yr file:\nmod sub_modules::bar\nimport std::io\n\npub def foo () {\n    println (\"Bar\");\n}\n\nAnd the file foo.yr : \nmod sub_modules::foo\nimport std::io\n\npub def foo () {\n    println (\"Foo\");\n}\n\nWhen using the symbol foo in the main module : \nimport sub_modules::bar, sub_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : foo called with {} work with both\n --> main.yr:(4,9)\n    | \n 4  |     foo ();\n    |         ^\nNote : candidate  --> main.yr:(4,9) : sub_modules::bar::foo ()-> void\nNote : candidate  --> main.yr:(4,9) : sub_modules::foo::foo ()-> void\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nYou can solve this problem, by replacing the call foo(), by sub_modules::foo::foo ().\n1.5. Public importation\nAs for all declaration, importation are private. It means that the\nimportation is not recursive. For example, if the module\nsub_modules::foo imports the module sub_modules::bar, and the\nmodule main import the module sub_modules::foo, all the public\nsymbols declared in sub_modules::bar will not be accessible in the\nmodule main.\nYou can of course, make a pub importation, to make the symbols of\nthe module sub_modules::bar visible for the module main.\n\nsub_modules/foo.yr\n\nmod sub_modules::foo\n\npub import sub_modules::bar\n\n\nsub_modules/bar.yr\n\nmod sub_modules::bar\nimport std::io\n\npub def bar () {\n    println (\"Bar\");\n}\n\n\nmain.yr\n\nmod main\nimport sub_modules::foo;\n\ndef main () {\n    bar ();\n}\n\n1.6. Include directory\nYou can use the -I option, to add a path to the include\ndirectory. This path will be used as if it was the current $(pwd). In\nother words, if you add the I -path/to/modules option, and you have a\nfile in path/to/modules/relative/to/my/file, the name of the module\nmust be relative::to::my::file.\ngyc -I ~/libs/ main.yr\n\nThis is how the standard library is included in the build, and how you\ncan access modules in std:: that are not located in $(pwd)/std/.\n1.7. Compilation of modules\nAll modules must be compiled, the import declaration will not\ncompile external modules.  For example, if you compile only the main\nmodule, you will get an error.\n\nmain.yr \n\nmod main\nimport sub_modules::foo;\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\n\nsub_modules/foo.yr\n\nmod sub_modules::foo\n\npub def foo () {}\n\n$ gyc main.yr\n/tmp/ccCOeXDq.o: In function `_Y4mainFZv':\nmain.yr:(.text+0x3e): undefined reference to `_Y11sub_modules3foo3fooFZv'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nThis means that the symbol foo declared in the module sub_modules::foo cannot be\nfound. So you have to write the command line.\n$ gyc main.yr sub_modules/foo.yr\nThe way gyc works is similar to all the compilers in the GCC\nsuite, so the way to create libraries, object files, etc. is the same.\n"},"objects/":{"url":"objects/","title":"Objects","keywords":"","body":"1.

Attributes\nA class can contain attributes, which are equivalent to fields for a\nstructure.  An attribute is declared as a variable, using the keyword\nlet. You must give at least the type to the declaration, but the\nvalue is not mandatory.\nclass Point {\n    let _x : i32;\n    let _y = 0;\n}\n\nAll attributes are protected by default, i.e. only this class and its\nheirs will have access to them. You can use the pub keyword to make\nthem public and usable everywhere.\n1.2. Constructor\nTo be instancible, a class must declare at least one constructor. The\nconstructor is always named self, and takes parameters to build the\nobject. The constructor must give a value to all the attributes of the\nclass, the attributes are initialized using the with keyword.\nclass Point {\n    let _x : i32;\n    let _y = 0;\n\n    // _y is already initialized\n    // it is not mandatory to add it in the with initialization\n    pub self () with _x = 12 {\n        // Try to print the attribute _x \n        // You will need to use self \n    }\n\n    pub self (x : i32, y : i32) with _x = x, _y = y {\n    }\n}\n\nOnce the class has constructors, you can call them using the following\nsyntax :\nlet p : Point = Point::new (); \nlet p2 : Point = Point::new (1, 2);\n// Try to add the following line : \n// let p3 : Point = null;\n\nConstructors, like methods are protected by default, you can use the\nkeyword pub to make them public and prv to make them private.\nA class is not a pointer, you can't make it null, that has no sense\nin Ymir.\nYou can call another constructor with the syntax with. When you call\nanother constructor, all fields are already initialized, so you cannot\ninitialize them again.\nclass Point {\n    // ... attributes\n\n    pub self () with self (0, 0) {}\n\n    pub self (x : i32, y : i32) with _x = x, _y = y {}\n}\n\n1.3. Methods\nMethods of a class are functions that are applicable to an object\ninstance. The methods are declared like function, but take the self\nas first parameter. The type of self is not specified because it is\nobvious.\nclass Point {\n    // ... the same declaration as above\n\n    pub def vector (self, other : Point) -> Point {\n        Point::new (other._x - self._x, other._y - self._y)\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let p1 = Point::new (1, 2), p2 = Point::new (2, 3);\n    let v = p1.vector (p2);\n}\n\nThe self instance is an alias of the object (Cf. Alias), which\nis imutable by default. You can make it mutable by using the mut\nkeyword. As for structures, the mutability of the attributes is\ndefined when they are declared. If an attribute is mutable, its\nmutability depends on the mutability of the instance of the object\nthat contains it.\nclass Point {\n    let mut _x : i32, mut _y = 0;\n\n    // ... the same constructors as above\n\n    pub def addOne (mut self) {\n    //          ^^^\n    // Try to remove the mut \n\n        self._x += 1;\n        self._y += 1;\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut p = Point::new (1, 2);\n    //  ^^^\n    // Try to remove the mut\n    (alias p).addOne ();\n//     ^^^^^\n// Try to remove the alias\n}\n\nAs you have guessed an object borrow data that are stored in the Heap,\nand is therefore a aliasable type. Everything that is applicable to\naliasable type Aliases is applicable to objects.\n1.4.

In the above example, there is no reason why we can\ninstantiate a Shape, so just mark the class as abstract.\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    pub self () {} // need a constructor to be heritable\n\n    pub def area (self)-> i32; // Method has no body\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    // ... attributes and constructors\n\n    // Try to remove this method definition\n    pub over area (self) -> i32 {\n        import std::math;\n        Math::PI * (self._radius * self._radius)\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let s : Shape = Circle::new (12);\n    //              ^^^^^^\n    // Try to replace by shape\n}\n\n1.5. Final class\nFinal classes declared with the custom attributes @final defines\nclasses that cannot have heirs. The custom attributes @final can\nalso be used on method to avoid overload from heir class.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass @abstract Shape {    \n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def area (self) -> i32;    \n}\n\nclass Rectangle over Shape {\n\n    let _length : i32;\n    let _width : i32;\n\n    pub self (l : i32, w : i32) with _length = l, _width = w {}\n\n    pub over @final area (self) -> i32 {\n        self._length * self._width\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass @final Square over Rectangle {    \n    pub self (l : i32) with super (l, l) {}\n\n    // Try to add this method\n    // pub over area (self) -> i32 {\n    //     self._length * self._width\n    // }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let s : Shape = Square::new (9);\n    println (s.area ());\n}\n\n"},"objects/traits.html":{"url":"objects/traits.html","title":"Traits","keywords":"","body":"1.

Example program1. Example program\nThis chapter presents an example of a program that implements a linked\nlist using the class system. You will see that even if you can't set\nan object instance to null, you can still implement the behavior,\nwithout risk of the program crashing.\nFirst of all, we have to define an element of the list, this element\ncan have a value, or be the end of the list.\nclass @abstract Node {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub def append (self, i : i32)-> Node;\n\n    impl Printable;\n}\n\nThis class is the ancestor of all things that can be found in a linked\nlist.  The append method, while creating a copy of the list, returns a\nnew list with element i appended at the end of the list. There are two\ntypes of nodes, a value or the end of the list. Let's start with the\nsimplest, the end of the list :\nclass None over Node {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub over append (self, i : i32) -> Node {\n        // We are at the end of the list\n        // we just have to return a node that contains the value\n\n        Some::new (i)\n    }\n\n    pub over print (self) {\n        print (\"END\");\n    }    \n}\n\nAnd the class Some, which contains a value: \nclass Some over Node {\n    let _value : i32;\n    let _next : Node;\n\n    pub {\n        /**\n         * This constructor is used when this node is the last value of the list\n         * It is followed by a None value\n         */\n         self (v : i32) with _value = v, _next = None::new () {}\n\n         self (v : i32, x : Node) with _value = v, _next = x {}\n\n\n         over append (self, i : i32) -> Node {\n             Some::new (self._value, self._next.append (i))\n         }        \n\n        over print (self) {\n            print (self._value, \"::\", self._next);        \n        }    \n    }\n}\n\nThere we are, the list is now usable:\ndef main () {\n    let x : Node = None::new ();\n    let y = x.append (12).append (8).append (3).append (9);\n    println (y);\n}\n\nYou should get the following output.\n12::8::3::9::END\nExercise: Without changing the main function, generate the\n  following result.

Function pointer1.1.1. Function pointer using reference1.2. Lambda function1.3. Closure1.3.1. Move closure1.3.2. Ref closure1. Functions\nWe have seen in the chapter Basic programming concepts how\nfunctions are written. In this chapter we will see more advanced\nfunction systems, named function pointer and closure.\n1.1. Function pointer\nA function pointer is a value that contains a function. It can be used\nto pass function as argument to other functions. The type of the\nfunction pointer is written using the keyword fn, and have the same\nsyntax as a function prototype, but without a name.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    f (41)\n}\n\ndef addOne (x : i32)-> i32\n    x + 1\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (&addOne);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nIn the above example, we have specified that the function foo take\nas parameter a function pointer, that takes an i32 and return a\ni32.\n1.1.1. Function pointer using reference\nFunction pointer can take reference parameters as normal functions.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (ref mut i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    let ref mut x = 41;\n    f (ref x);\n    x\n}\n\ndef mutAddOne (ref mut x : i32) {\n    x = x + 1;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (&mutAddOne);\n    println (x);\n}\n\n1.2. Lambda function\nLambda function are anonymous function that have the same behavior as\nnormal function, but don't have a name. They are declared using the\ntoken | surrounding the parameters instead of parentheses in order\nto dinstinguish them from tuple. \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x : i32, y : i32|-> i32 { \n        x + y\n    };\n    println (x (1, 2));\n}\n\nAs you may have noticed, there is no conflict between the variable x\ndeclared in the function main, and the first parameter of the lambda\nalso named x. In many cases the type of the parameters and return\ntype can be infered, and are therefore optional. The above example can\nthen be rewritten into :\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x, y| x + y;    \n    println (x (1, 2));\n\n\n    // The types are not given, then you can also write \n    println (x (1.3, 2.9));    \n}\n\nThe token => can be added after the prototype de make the lambda a\nbit more readable. It is just syntaxic and has no impact on the\nbehavior of the lambda.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x, y| => x + y;    \n    println (x (1, 2));\n\n\n    // The types are not given, then you can also write \n    println (x (1.3, 2.9));    \n}\n\nLambda function can evidently be used as function argument, like\nnormal functions.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (i32, i32)-> i32, x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 {\n    f (x, y) + f (y, x)\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (|x, y|=> x * y).foo (3, 7);\n    // Dotcall syntax, you can of course write it as follows : \n    // foo (|x, y| x*y, 3, 7);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nLambda function that are not typed are special element, that have no\nvalue. If it is not possible to infer the type of the lambda, and you\ntry to use it as a value, then you will get an error. Ymir allows\nto put an untyped lambda inside an immutable var, to ease its usage,\nbut the lambda still does not have any value.  With the following\ncode, you should get an error.\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x| x + 1;\n    let mut y = x;\n}\n\nError : type mut fn (any)-> any is not complete\n --> main.yr:(4,13)\n    | \n 4  |     let x = |x| x + 1;\n    |             ^\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(5,13)\n    | \n 5  |     let mut y = x;\n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nWhen you want to return a lambda function as a function value, you can\nhave the same error.  To avoid this, you can use the keyword \"return\",\nwhich will impose the type of the function return and allow an\nimplicit deduction of the lambda type. For example, the following code : \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> fn (i32)-> i32 {\n    return |x| => x + 12\n//  ^^^^^^\n// Try to remove the return here\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo ();\n    println (x (30));\n}\n\n1.3. Closure\nLambda function have no access on the scope of the function that\ndeclare them. If you try to compile the following program, you should\nget an error.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let i = 12;\n    let x = | | {\n        println (i);\n    };\n    x ();\n}\n\nThe variable i does not exist in the scope of the lambda function.\nError : undefined symbol i\n --> main.yr:(6,11)\n    | \n 6  |     println (i);\n    |              ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nClosure are a function pointer that capture the environment of the\nfunction that has declared them. There is two type of closure,\nreference closure and move closure.\n1.3.1. Move closure\nA move closure, declared by the keyword \"move\" followed by a lambda\nfunction, has access to the parent environment by value. All included\nvalues are immutable, and there is no way to make them mutable. A move\nclosure is safe to use, and in most cases totally sufficient, and is\npreferable to the reference closure.\nUnlike function pointer, the closure type is created with the keyword\ndg for delegate. A delegate is a function pointer with an\nenvironment, and is the general case of a closure.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : dg (i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    f (12)\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let i = 30;\n    let x = foo (move |x|=> x + i);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nMove closures can be returned safely, since the closure is done by\nvalue, there is no problem with the lifetime of the variables that are\nenclosed.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo ()-> dg (i32)-> i32 {\n    let mut i = 30;\n    return move |x : i32| x + i;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let z = foo ();\n    println (z (12));\n}\n\n1.3.2. Ref closure\nA ref closure is declared with the keyword ref instead of the keyword\nmove. As its name implies, a ref closure has access to the parent\nenvironment by reference. All included values are always immutable,\nbut a change in the parent environment will also have an impact on the\nenclosed environment. To clearly illustrate this behavior, the following\nsource code shows the difference between a ref closure and a move\nclosure.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut z = 1;\n\n    let m = move |x : i32| => x + z;\n    let r = ref  |x : i32| => x + z;\n\n    z = 30;\n    println (m (12));\n    println (r (12));\n}\n\n13\n42\nA ref closure is not safe to be returned, it enclose refence to local\nvariable. For the moment gyc does not provide static verification\nto ensure that no ref closure is returned, or at least that the ref\nclosure that is returned does not enclosed local variable whose\nlifetime will end with the end of the parent environment.\n"},"pattern/":{"url":"pattern/","title":"Pattern matching","keywords":"","body":"1. Pattern matching1.1. Matching multiple values1.2. Variable pattern1.3. Destructuring patterns1.3.1. Destructuring structure1.3.2. Destructuring class1. Pattern matching\nThe pattern matching is an important part of the Ymir language. It\nallows to make test over values and moreover on types, especially when\nit comes to objects. The pattern matching syntax always start with the\nkeyword match followed by an expression, and then patterns enclosed\nbetween {}.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    match (42) {\n        1 => println (\"The answer is one\");\n        2 => println (\"The answer is two\");\n        _ => println (\"I don't know, but neither one nor two...\")\n    }\n}\n\nMatch like every other element of the Ymir language are\nexpression. You can use a match to get a value, but all branch of the\nmatch must have the same type. If the case that the compiler is not\nsure that a branch will be entered and will return a value in every\ncase, you will get an error saying that the pattern matching does not\nhave a default value.\ndef main () {\n    let x = match (12) {\n        1 => 8\n        2 => 7\n        3 => 6\n    };\n}\n\nError : match of type i32 has no default match case\n --> main.yr:(2,13)\n    | \n 2  |     let x = match (12) {\n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n1.1. Matching multiple values\nYou can check multiple values in one pattern with the token |, which\nsemantic is the same as a or. You can also check interval using the\nkeyword .. and ....\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    match 42 {\n        1 .. 10 => {\n            println (\"The answer is between 1 and 10 not included\");\n        }\n        10 ... 40 {\n            println (\"The answer is between 10 and 40 included\");\n        }\n        41 | 42 | 43 => {\n            println (\"The answer is either 41, 42 or 43\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe pattern are tested in the order they are written, and the matching\nnever enter two different pattern even if two of them return a valid\nmatch.\n1.2. Variable pattern\nYou can use a variable that will take the value of the element that is\nmatched. The variable is declared like a standard variable declaration\nbut with token let ommitted. You don't have to specify the name or\nthe type of the variable, but there must be the token : somewhere,\nso if you don't wan't to specify the type, you can just use the token\n_.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    match 13 {\n        _ : i32 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, but I don't care about the value\");\n        }\n        _ : i32 = 13 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, whose value is 13\");\n        }\n        _ : _ = 13 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, whose value is 13, but I didn't checked the type\");\n        }        \n        x : i32 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, and the value is : \", x);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn the above example, every test will pass, but only the first pattern\nwill be evaluated, and the output of this program will only be : It\nis a i32, but I don't care about the value \nYou can pass a value by reference in a pattern matching to modify it\ninside a valid pattern.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut z = 1;\n    match ref z {\n        // ^^^\n        // Try to remove the ref\n        ref mut x : _ => {\n            x = 42;\n        }\n    }\n\n    println (z);\n}\n\n1.3. Destructuring patterns\nThere are two types of destructuring patters, for tuple by using\npattern inside parenthese, or for structure and classes by using a\nCall syntax. When you want to destructure a tuple, you will just have\nto use parentheses that will surround any patterns, that are presented\nin this section.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let tuple = (1, 'x', 3.14)\n\n    match tuple {\n        (_ : i32 = 1, _, _) => {\n            println (\"This tuple has an arity of three and its first element is an i32, whose value is 1\");\n        } \n        (x : _, y : _, z : _) => {\n            println (\"This tuple has an arity of three, and its values are : (\", x, \", \", y, \", \", z, \")\");\n        }        \n    }\n}\n\n1.3.1. Destructuring structure\nThe destructurating of a structure is made like a call of the\nstructure. But you don't have to secify all the fields, but only those\nyou want to check.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct\n| x : i32\n| y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let p = Point (1, 2);\n\n    match p {\n        Point (y-> 1) => {\n            println (\"Point where y is equal to 1\");\n        }\n        Point (1) => {\n            println (\"Point where x is equal to 1\");\n        }\n        Point () => {\n            println (\"Any point\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nYou can of course with a variable pattern refer to the values later in\nthe pattern, for both the structure or even its fields. Reference\nvariable works the same as well.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct\n| x : i32\n| y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let point = Point (1, 2);\n\n    match point {\n        p : _ = Point (y-> y : i32) => {\n            println (p, \" is a point, whose y field is equal to \", y);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n1.3.2. Destructuring class\nThe syntax for destructuring object is the same as the syntax for\ndestructuring structure. However, the parameters inside the\nparentheses will referes to object attributes that must be public in\nthe context of the pattern matching.\nimport std::io\n\nclass Point {\n    pub let x : i32 = 1;\n    let y : i32 = 2;\n\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let p = Point::new ();\n\n    match p {\n        Point (x-> 1) => {\n        //     ^\n        // Try to replace with y\n            println (p.x, \" is a equal to 1\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nUnlike structure destructuring, the type of the object is also\nchecked. It can be useful when dealing with inheritance. \nimport std::io\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Rectangle over Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo () -> Shape {\n    Circle::new ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let s = foo ();\n    match s {\n        Circle () => {\n            println (\"Foo returned a circle\");\n        }\n        Rectangle () => {\n            println (\"Foo returned a rectangle\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIt is the only way to check a inheritance in Ymir, and this way is\nsafe. In many language like Java, D or C++, you will have the right to\nuse the casting system, that will have a undefined behavior in C++,\nand make a program crash in Java, and will return the value null in\nD. Those three behavior are not acceptable since they are not\nsafe. The pattern matching will allow you to specify the behavior when\nthe cast has failed, for example, if you want to get the center of\ncircle :\nimport std::io\n\nimport std::io\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Rectangle over Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    pub let center : i32 ;\n\n    self (center : i32) with center = center {}\n}\n\n/**\n * Don't worry I will return you a circle\n*/\ndef foo () -> Shape {\n    Rectangle::new ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let circle = foo ();\n    let center = match circle {\n        Circle (center-> center : _) => center\n        _ => {\n            println (\"That's not a circle, foo lied!\");\n            0 // No need to have confidence in foo \n        }\n    };\n    println (\"The center of the circle is : \", center);\n}\n\n"},"templates/":{"url":"templates/","title":"Templates","keywords":"","body":"1.

The template system of Ymir is\npowerful, and allows you to generate code, that will be used\nmany times for many purpose, by writting minimal source code. \n1.1. Template argument syntax\nThe template arguments are declared using the token !, followed by\none are multiple arguments, enclosed inside parentheses. Template\narguments are elements that must be known by the compiler at compile\ntime, in order to produce the template specialization and symbol\ndefinition. \nfoo!i32 (12); // One template argument (i32)\nfoo!(i32, f64) (12); // Two template arguments\n\nWhen the arguments, are also template, the parentheses are mandatory\neven if there is only one parameter, to avoid ambiguity.\nfoo!(foo!i32) (); // Ok\nfoo!foo!i32 (); // No\n\n1.2. Template definition syntax\nMultiple symbols in Ymir can be templates. Every template symbol\nhas a name, and the template parameters are following that name. For\nexample, function can be templates :\ndef foo (T) (a : T) {\n}\n\nIn the above example, we can see two set of parentheses, the first one\ndefine the template parameters, and the second one the parameters of\nthe function foo. Structure, class, enum, traits and internal\nmodules, can also be templates.\nclass A (T) {\n    let value : T;\n    // ...\n}\n\nstruct \n| x : T\n-> S (T);\n\nenum \n| X = cast!T (12)\n-> F (T);\n\nmod Inner (T) {\n    pub def foo (a : T) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\ntrait Z (T) {\n    pub def foo (self, a : T)-> T;\n}\n\n1.3. Template instanciation\nWhen a template symbol is defined, and the syntax of template call is\nused, a specialization is performed. The symbol, that match the most\nthe template arguments to the template parameter is chosen, and\ninstanciated. \nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!(i32) (12);\n}\n\nWhen the template symbol is a function, it can happened that the\ntemplate parameters can be infered from the parameters of the\nfunction. For example in the above example, there is no need to\nspecify a template call, and you can write as follows :\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (12); // T, will be infered to i32\n    foo (\"Hi !!\"); // T, will be infered to [c32]\n}\n\nThis cannot be done for structure or module. However, this is possible\nto do on classes, and this will be presented a little later, in the\nfollowing section of the document.\nWhen a template call is made on a function that take only one\nargument, you can use the DotCall syntax and forget the parameter\nparentheses. This can be used to simplify the syntax that is obvious\nanyway.\ndef foo (T, X) (_ : X) {\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    (12).foo!i32; \n    // It is exaclty the same as : \n    // (12).foo!(i32) (); \n}\n\nYou can note that only one argument has been passed to the template\nfunction. The second one is optionnal, since it can be infered from\nthe function parameter. If the function definition was foo (X, T)\n(_ : X), the inference could no more be done, the template call is\nchecked first, so X will be set to i32, and T could not be infered\nfrom anything, so you should get the following error :\nError : call operator is not defined for type foo (T)(_ : X)-> void and {i32}\n --> main.yr:(5,9)\n    | \n 5  |     (12).foo!i32; \n    |         ^\n    | Note : candidate foo --> main.yr:(1,5) : foo (T)(_ : X)-> void\n    | Error : unresolved template\n    |  --> main.yr:(1,13)\n    |     | \n    |  1  | def foo (X, T) (_ : X) {\n    |     |             ^\n    |------------------------------ \n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n1.3.1. Template class instanciation\nWhen a class template is declared, the compiler is sometimes able to\ninfer the type of the templates from the argument passed to the\nconstructors. The rule is the same as for function\ninstanciation. \nimport std::io;\n\nclass X (T, U) {\n    let x : T, y : U;\n\n    pub self (x : T, y : U) with x = x, y = y {}    \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = X::new (1, 'r');\n    let b = X::new ([1, 2], \"foo\");\n\n    println (a::typeinfo.name);\n    println (b::typeinfo.name);\n}\n\nLike functions you can make a two times validation of the templates of\na class. You don't have to give all the template parameters when\ninvoking a template call, but all the templates must be validated at\nthe end.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass X (T, U) {\n    let y : U;\n\n    pub self (y : U) with y = y {}    \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = X!(i32)::new ('r');\n    println (x::typeinfo.name);\n}\n\n"},"templates/special.html":{"url":"templates/special.html","title":"Specialization","keywords":"","body":"1. Template specialization1.1. Of specifier1.2. Struct and Class specifier1.3. Implement specialization1.4. Variadic templates1. Template specialization\nWe have seen in the last chapter, how to create simple template\nfunction, that can be call with any type. Sometimes, you may want to\nbe more precize in the kind of type that can be used in a\nfunction. For example, when you want to sort an array, you don't wan't\nto be able to call the function with just a i32, but only with\narrays.\nThose kind of specialization can be achieved thanks to template\nspecifiers.\n1.1. Of specifier\nThe Of specifier declared with the keyword of, is used to tell to\nthe compiler that the type that will be used must fit to a specific\npattern. It can be either a type, or a more specific template.\nimport std::io;\n\n/**\n * This function will only be callable, with a i32 as T\n */\ndef foo (T of i32) (_ : T) {\n    println (\"First ??\");\n}\n\n/**\n * This function will only be callable, with a type that fit the Z pattern\n * That is to say every type\n */\ndef foo (T of Z, Z) (_ : T) {\n    println (\"Second ?\");\n}\n\n/**\n * This function will be only callable, with an array of Z, where Z can be anything\n */\ndef foo (T of [Z], Z) (_ : T) {\n    println (\"Third !\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ([1, 2]);\n}\n\nIn the above example, you may have noticed that, two functions can be\ncalled by the expression foo ([1, 2]). The second and third\nones. The template definition that match the best the types, will be\nused. Here, this is the third one, so the ouput of the program will be : \nThird !\n1.2. Struct and Class specifier\nThe keywords struct and class can be used to specify that the\naccepted template argument must be respecitvely a structure or a\nclass type.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n-> X;\n\nclass A {\n    self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo (class T) () {\n    println (\"Class !\");\n}\n\ndef foo (struct T) () {\n    println (\"Struct !\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!(A) ();\n    foo!(X) ();\n}\n\n1.3. Implement specialization\nThe keyword impl can be used to check that the used type implement a\ndefined trait, for example :\nimport std::io;\n\ntrait Getter (T) {\n    def get (self)-> T;\n}\n\nclass A {\n\n    self () {}\n\n    impl Getter!i32 {\n        over get (self)-> i32 {\n            12\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef foo (T impl Getter!X, X) (a : T) -> X {\n    a.get ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new ();\n    println (foo (a));\n}\n\n1.4. Variadic templates\nVariadic templates are special templates, that takes an arbitrary\nnumber of template arguments. They are defined using the token ....\nThe parameters will be put in a tuple, and will be considered exaclty\nas if they were really a tuple. \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (T...) (a : T) {\n    println (a.0, expand a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n}\n\nAs you may have guessed by now, the println function is a variadic\ntemplate function. Variadic template can also be used on every\ntemplate symbol, like structures. \nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| foo : fn (T)-> i32 \n -> X (T...);\n\ndef add (x : i32, y : i32)-> i32\n    x + y\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = X!(i32, i32) (&add);\n    println (x.foo (12, 30));\n}\n\n"},"templates/cte.html":{"url":"templates/cte.html","title":"Compile time execution","keywords":"","body":"1. Compilation time execution1.1. Compilation time values1.2. Is operator1.3. Template function test1.4. Compilation time condition1.5. Class compilation test1. Compilation time execution\nIn Ymir, templates are seen as compilation time execution\nparameters. They can be used to create values, symbols, are to make\nthe compiler take decisions. \n1.1. Compilation time values\nBasically, every values can be know at compilation time as long as they do\nnot implies variable, or dynamic branching. For example this value\nfoo () acquired from the following source code can be known at\ncompilation time.\ndef foo () -> i32\n    bar () + baz ()\n\ndef bar () -> i32 \n    12\n\ndef baz () -> i32\n    30\n\nTo see if a value can be known at compilation time a simple test is to use\nit as a template parameter. Or by using the keyword cte.\nExercise : Try to compile the\nfollowing source code with the option -fdump-tree-gimple.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> i32\n    bar () + baz ()\n\ndef bar () -> i32 \n    12\n\ndef baz () -> i32\n    30\n\ndef printTemplate (V : i32) ()-> void {\n    println (V);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    printTemplate!(foo ());\n    let z = cte foo ();\n    println (z);\n}\n\nThis will generate a file named main.yr.004t.gimple containing a\nprecompiled version of the code. You should get in this file a\ndefinition of the function printTemplate, that prints the value\n42.\n// ...\n\nmain::printTemplate(42)::printTemplate ()\n{\n  {\n    _Y3std2io11printlnNi327printlnFi32Zv (42);\n  }\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n  {\n    signed int z;\n\n    _Y4main16printTemplateN4213printTemplateFZv ();\n    z = 42;\n    _Y3std2io11printlnNi327printlnFi32Zv (z);\n  }\n}\nThis chapter does not cover compilation time values, which will be\ndetailed in the next chapter, but it is important to know what a\ncompilation time value is in order to understand the following\nsections.\n1.2. Is operator\nThe is operator is used to perform a template test that will be\nevaluated to a bool value. This is useful for all of the following\nprinciples. The syntax is the following : \nis ! template_arguments templates_parameters\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) () {\n    let isI32 = is!(T) (X of i32);\n    println (isI32);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!i32 ();\n    foo!f32 ();\n}\n\n1.3. Template function test\nWhen declaring a function with the keyword def, you can add a test\nthat will be evaluated at compilation time, that will force the compiler\nto decide wether or not the symbol must be declared. \nimport std::io;\nimport std::traits;\n\ndef if (isIntegral!T) foo (T) (a : T)-> T\n    a + cast!T(30)\n\n\ndef main () {\n    println (foo (12));     \n}\n\nThe function isIntegral is declared within the module\nstd::traits. This module contains a list of compilation time definitions\nthat are designed to help for the specialization of templates . Each\nvalue that can be known at compilation time can be used in the test of a\nmodel function.\n1.4. Compilation time condition\nThe keyword cte in front of a if condition defines that the\ncondition test must be performed at compilation time. Only the block of\nthe condition that is satisfied will be compiled.\nimport std::traits;\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) (a : T)-> T {\n    cte if (isIntegral!T) {\n        a + 30\n    } else {\n        // Inconsistent operation on integrals\n        a [0]\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    println (foo (12));\n}\n\nAny condition that can be known at compilation time can be used as a test\nof a compilation time condition. \n1.5. Class compilation test\nThe keyword cte can also be used inside class definition to make\ndecision at compilation time. The syntax is the same as a compilation\ntime condition.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass Container (T) {\n    cte if !(is!(T)(X of void)) {\n        pub let value : T;\n    }\n\n    cte if !(is!(T)(X of void)) {\n        pub self (x : T) with value = x {}\n    } else {\n        pub self () {}\n    }\n\n    impl std::io::Printable {\n        pub over print (self) {\n            cte if (is!(T)(X of void)) {\n                print (\"Container!(void)\")\n            } else {\n                print (\"Container::value (\", self.value, \")\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = Container!(void)::new ();\n    let b = Container::new (42);\n\n    println (a);\n    println (b);\n}\n\n"},"templates/values.html":{"url":"templates/values.html","title":"Template as values","keywords":"","body":"1. Template values1.1. Compilation time variable1.2. Template type for compilation time variable1.3. Function as compilation time variable1. Template values\nIn the previous chapter, we saw that some values can be known at the\ntime of compilation. These values can be used for the compiler to\ndecide which part of the code should be compiled and which part should\nnot.\n1.1. Compilation time variable\nA compilation time value can also be passed as a parameter of a\ntemplate.  A template argument defined like a variable with the token\n:, will accept a compilation time value of the type that is\nspecified on the right operand. The left operand will then be an alias\nof the value, that will be pasted each time it is referenced in the\nbody of the template.\nFor example the following program, compute the value of fibonacci at\ncompilation time. You can see that the template fibo accept a\ncompilation time value of type i32.\nimport std::io\n\ndef fibo (N : i32) () -> i32 {\n    cte if (N == 0)\n        0\n    else cte if (N \nExercise : Try to remove the cte keywords in the example above.\nThe compilation time execution is really efficient, for example the following\ncode will compile without any problem.\nimport std::io\n\ndef fibo (N : u64) () -> u64 {\n    cte if (N == 0u64)\n        0u64\n    else cte if (N \n1.2. Template type for compilation time variable\nThe type of the compilation time variable can be a template. In that\ncase the system works like for Of specifier, and the template type\nmust be declared after in the template parameters. For example, the\nfollowing template function will accept any compilation time value.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (N : T, T) () {\n    println (T::typeid, \"(\", N, \")\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!(42);\n    foo!(\"Hi !\");\n}\n\nCompilation time values, can also be used to get an static array of a\nspecific size. This evidently works only on static arrays, and not on\nslice, because we need to know the size of the array at compilation\ntime.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (ARRAY of [T; N], T, N : usize) (a : ARRAY) {\n    println (\"Got an array of size : \", N);\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let array = [0; 10u64];\n    foo (array);\n}\n\n1.3. Function as compilation time variable\nStandard function and lambda function can be used as compilation time\nvalues. As for any other compilation time values, the variables are\ndeclared using the token : inside of the template parameters.  The\ntype of a compilation time function, is a function pointer, that is\nthus declared with the keywords fn. \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (FUN : fn ()-> T, T) () -> T {\n    println (\"Execution of a function : \");\n    FUN () + 30\n}\n\ndef bar (FUN : fn (X)-> T, T, X...)

Operator overloading\nThe operator overload is done by rewriting the operations applied on\nobjects operands. No new syntax is used for operator overloading. They\nuse compilation time values, and template definition to choose the\ncorrect operator.\n1.1. Unary operator\nThe overloading of binary operators is done by defining the opUnary function.\nIt is rewritten as follows: \n\n\n\nexpression\nrewrite\n\n\n\n\n-e\ne.opUnary!(\"-\")\n\n\n*e\ne.opUnary!(\"*\")\n\n\n!e\ne.opUnary!(\"!\")\n\n\n\nimport std::io;\n\nclass A  {\n    let a : f32;\n\n    pub self (a : f32) with a = a {} \n\n    pub def opUnary (\"-\") (self) -> A {\n    A::new (-self.a)\n    }\n\n    pub def opUnary (op : [c32]) (self) -> A {\n        if (op == \"!\")\n            A::new (1.f / self.a)\n        else\n            self\n    }\n\n    impl std::io::Printable {\n        pub over print (self) {\n            print (\"A(\", self.a, \")\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new (42.0f);\n    println (!a); \n    // This is exactly the same as : \n    // println (a.opUnary!(\"!\") ());\n}\n\n1.2. Binary operator\nBinary operators are also overloadable. As for unary operators, this\noverload can only be done on objects. They are rewritten with the\nfunction opBinary and opBinaryRight. The rewritte with a call to\nthe function opBinary is tested first, and if it does not compile,\nthen the rewritte with the call to the function opBinaryRight is\nthen tried.\nThe following operators are overloadable. The use indicated in the\nleft column is only an indication and corresponds to the common use of\nthese operators, but they can of course be used for other purposes.\n\n\n\nMath\n+\n-\n*\n/\n%\n^^\n\n\n\nBitwise\n|\n&\n^\n \n >> \n\n\n\nArray\n~\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>` |    `~` | `&`  | -->\nimport std::io;\n\nclass A {\n    let a : i32;\n\n    pub self (a : i32) with a = a {}\n\n    pub def opBinary (\"+\") (self, a : i32) -> A {\n        A::new (self.a + a)\n    }\n\n    pub def opBinaryRight (\"+\") (self, a : i32)-> A\n        self + a\n\n    pub def opBinary (\"-\") (self, a : i32) -> A {\n        A::new (self.a - a)\n    }\n\n    pub def opBinaryRight (\"-\") (self, a : i32)-> A\n        A::new (a - self.a)\n\n\n    impl std::io::Printable {\n        pub over print (self) {\n            print (self.a);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new (12);\n    println (30 - a);\n}\n\n1.3. Comparison operators\nThe comparison operators are also overloadable, but not like binary\noperators. The equality and comparison are treated via two different\nfunctions opEquals and opCmp. Because while almost all types can\nbe compared for equality, only some have meaningful order comparison. \nThe opCmp function is used for the operators , >,  and >=\nonly. And the function opEquals is used for the operator == and\n!=. When the method opEquals is not defined for the type, the\ncompiler will try to use the method opCmp instead. When both the\nfunction are defined, it is up to the user to ensure that these two\nfunctions are consistent.\nIndeed, it is impossible to verify that in a general case. You may\nwant for example to define a set object, where the operator x \nstand for x is a strict subset of y. Therefore, if neither x \nand y  are true, that does not implies that x == y.\n1.3.1. Overloading == and !=\nExpression of the form a != b, are rewritten into !(a == b),\ntherefore there is only one function to define. \nimport std::io\n\nclass Point {\n\n    let x : i32, y : i32;\n\n    pub self (x : i32, y : i32) with x = x, y = y {}\n\n    pub def opEquals (self, other : Point) -> bool {\n        self.x == other.x && self.y == other.y\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () throws AssertError {\n    let a = Point::new (1, 2);\n    let b = Point::new (2, 3);\n    let c = Point::new (1, 2);\n    assert (a == c);\n    assert (a != b);\n}\n\nThe operator opEquals is supposed commutative, so when the operator\nis only defined for the type on the right operand, the operation will\nsimply be rewritten reversely.\nimport std::io\n\nclass MyInt {\n\n    let i : i32;\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with i = i {}\n\n    pub def opEquals (self, i : i32) -> bool {\n        self.i == i\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () throws AssertError {\n    let mi = MyInt::new (8);\n    assert (8 == mi);\n}\n\n1.3.2. Overloading , =\nThose operators are overloadable by rewritting and calling the method\nopCmp. This method must return an signed integer element. The\nfollowing table presents how the operators are rewritten.\n\n\n\ncomparison\nrewrite 1\nrewrite 2\n\n\n\n\na \na.opCmp (b) \nb.opCmp (a) > 0\n\n\na > b\na.opCmp (b) > 0\nb.opCmp (a) \n\n\na \na.opCmp (b) \nb.opCmp (a) >= 0\n\n\na >= b\na.opCmp (b) >= 0\nb.opCmp (a) >= 0\n\n\n\nThe first rewrite is tried first, if it fails, the second is tested.\nIf the method opEquals is not defined the method opCmp will be\nused, and will be rewritten as a.opCmp (b) == 0.\nimport std::io\n\nclass MyInt {\n\n    let i : i32;\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with i = i {}\n\n    pub def opCmp (self, i : i32) -> i32 {\n        self.i - i\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () throws AssertError {\n    let mi = MyInt::new (8);\n    assert (7 \n1.4. Assignment\nThe assignment operator is not overloadable, it will always perform\nthe same operation. However, the shortcut operators +=, -=, *=\netc, are usable on object when oveloading the binary operator. In that\ncase, the method opBinary must return a mutable object.\nimport std::io\n\nclass MyInt {\n\n    pub let i : i32;\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with i = i {}\n\n    pub def opBinary (\"+\") (self, a : i32)-> mut MyInt {\n        //                                   ^^^\n        //                     Try to remove the mut there\n        MyInt::new (self.i + a)\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut mi = MyInt::new (8);\n    mi += 9;\n    println (mi.i);\n}\n\n1.5. Access operator\nThe operator of index [] is overloadable by the method\nopIndex. This method will simply be called with the parameters\npassed inside of the brackets. For example, the following operation a\n[b, c, d] will be rewrite into a.opIndex (b, c, d).\nimport std::io\n\nclass A {\n    let i : [i32];\n\n    pub self (a : [i32]) with i = a {}\n\n    pub def opIndex (self, x : i32) -> i32 \n        throws OutOfArray\n    {\n        self.i [x]\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws OutOfArray, AssertError\n{\n    let i = A::new ([1, 2, 3]);\n    assert (i [2] == 3)\n}\n\n1.6. Contain operator\nThe contain operator is a binary operator used to check if an element\nis inside another one. This operator is defined using the keyword\nin. Unlike other operator, the rewritte for the overloading is made\nonly once on the right operand, and call the method opContains. The\nexpression a !in b will be rewritten into !(a in b).\nclass A {\n\n    let a : [i32];\n\n    pub self (a : [i32]) with a = a {}\n\n    pub def opContains (self, i : i32)-> bool {\n        for j in self.a {\n            if (i == j) return true;\n        }\n        false\n    }    \n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws AssertError\n{\n    let i = A::new ([1, 2, 3]);\n    assert (2 in i);\n    assert (9 !in i);\n}\n\n"},"errors/main.html":{"url":"errors/main.html","title":"Error handling","keywords":"","body":"1.

An exception is a class that inherits the core class\ncore::exception::Exception. \nException are followed by the compiler, that will not allow you to\nforget the possibility that they may occur, and will force you to\nhandle them. There are two possibilities for error handling, either\nyou rethrow it in the function level by using the throws keyword,\neither you catch it with the keyword catch.\n1.1. Rethrowing\nThe error rethrowing is a way of defining that a function may throw an\nexception, and that this exception must be taking into account by a\ncaller function. It is a system relativelly similar to error\nrethrowing in Java, apart that the specific name of the exception\nmust be written in the possible rethrowed exception. That is to say,\nyou can't write that you want to rethrow any kind of exception, by\nwritting throws Exception. \nThanks to that, the compiler will always be able to check each kind of\nexceptions, and force the user to handle them.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) \n    throws AssertError\n{\n    assert (i \nAs previously stated, the name of the exceptions specified in the\nprototype function must be the actual name of the exception, not the\nname of an ancestor.\n\nclass ParentException over Exception {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\nclass ChildException over Exception {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo () \n    throws ChildException\n//         ^^^^^\n// Try to replace by Parent, or to remove just Exception\n{\n    throws ChildException::new ()\n}\n\n\ndef main () \n    throws ChildException\n//         ^^^^^\n//  Try to do the same here\n{\n    foo ()\n}\n\nThis system assure that, if a function is not marked as a throwing\nfunction, it is safe, and the program won't crash when calling\nit. Therefore, if the main function of a program is safe, then the\nprogram can't crash.\n1.2. Catching exception\nThe keyword catch define a catching block. It must follow a scope\ndefined by {}, and must catch all the exception that may occur in\nthat scope. The syntax of catching exception is similar to the pattern\nmatching.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () \n    throws AssertError\n{\n    assert (false);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n} catch {\n    _ : AssertError => {\n        println (\"Assert occured\");\n    }\n}\n\nThere are no implicit rethrowing of exception in a catch block, it is\nup to the user to force the rethrowing.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) \n    throws AssertError\n{\n\n    assert (i  i32\n    throws OutOfArray\n{\n    let i = [1];\n    i [9]\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws OutOfArray\n{\n    foo (8);\n    bar ();\n} catch {\n    _ : AssertError => {\n        println (\"Assert occured\");\n    }\n    x : OutOfArray => {\n        throw x;\n    }\n    // Try to remove this second pattern match\n}\n\n1.2.1. Recovering with catch\nIn Ymir everything has a values, that is not different for a catch\nblock. When an error occurs, you may wan't to provide a default value,\nthat will help to recover from an error. The value of a catch block is\nthe value of the pattern matching it contains, and must have the same\ntype as the value of the block to which it is attached.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo ()-> i32 {\n    let i = [1];\n    i [9]\n} catch {\n    _ : OutOfArray => {\n        println (\"Out of array !\")\n        42\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (); // Call foo is safe\n    println (x);\n}\n\n1.3. Mixin with type option\nThe standard library provide an option type, in std::option. An\noption type is a monadic type, that may contain a value, or not. This\nis mainly used to handle errors when a computation might fail and\nreturn nothing.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) -> Option!i32 {\n    if (i \nIn Ymir you can easily transform an exception into an option type,\nby returning a None value, when an error occured. The function\ntoOption defined in the module std::option takes a function as\ntemplate argument, and transform the result of this function into a\noption type. If the function throws an exception, the value None is\nreturned.\nimport std::option\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) -> i32 \n    throws AssertError \n{\n    assert (i \nThrowing function are unsafe function, therefore they cannot be used\nas function pointer. In addition closure function (or lambda\nfunctions) must be safe, and the compiler won't allow you to define a\nfunction pointer that may throw an exception. For example, with the\nfollowing example, you should get an error :\ndef main () {\n    let x = |i : i32| => {\n        assert (i \nError : lambda functions must be safe, but there are exceptions that are not caught\n --> main.yr:(2,13)\n    | \n 2  |     let x = |i : i32| => {\n    |             ^\n    | Note : core::exception::AssertError\n    |  --> main.yr:(3,2)\n    |     | \n    |  3  |     assert (i For the same reason, the following code will also result in a\ncompilation error :\nimport std::option\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) -> i32 \n    throws AssertError \n{\n    assert (i \nError : can't create a function pointer from function main::foo (i : i32)-> i32 that might throw exception\n --> main.yr:(12,15)\n    | \n12  |     let ptr = &foo;\n    |               ^\n    | Note : throws core::exception::AssertError\n    |------------------------------ \n\nError : undefined symbol ptr\n --> main.yr:(13,14)\n    | \n13  |     println (ptr (12));\n    |              ^^^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nThanksfully, the standard function toOption, allows you to avoid\nthat error, and transform the function into a safe one that will return\nan option type.\nimport std::option\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) -> i32 \n    throws AssertError \n{\n    assert (i \n"},"errors/scope.html":{"url":"errors/scope.html","title":"Scope guards","keywords":"","body":"1. Scope guards1.1. Success scope guard1.2. Failure scope guard1.3. Exit scope1. Scope guards\nIn the last section we have seen the catch keyword that create a\nscope guard to catch exception that make occur in a specific scope. In\nthis section, we will introduce three different scope guards,\nsuccess, failure and exit.\nAs for the catch scope guard those are attached to a scope defined\nby {}. But unlike, the catch scope guard, they do not have impact on\nthe value of the scope to which they are attached.\n1.1. Success scope guard\nThe success scope guard is the simplest scope guard that exists, it is\njust a way to perform operation at the end of a scope if everything\nwent as wanted, and no exception has been thrown.\nimport std::io\n\ndef bar () -> i32 {\n    println (\"In bar\");\n    42\n}\n\ndef foo () -> i32 {\n    println (\"In foo\");\n    bar ()\n} success {\n    println (\"Exiting foo\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (); \n}\n\nThe scope success is the last thing executed in the block, so the\nresult will be the following.\nIn foo\nIn bar\nExiting foo\n1.2. Failure scope guard\nThe failure scope guard is the exact opposite of the success scope\nguard. It will only be triggered when an error occured in the scope to\nwhich it is attached. Failure scope guard does not catch exception,\nthey are just there to perform statements, when an exception has been\nthrown. \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) -> i32\n    throws AssertError\n{\n    assert (i \nThe assertion will failed, and the output will be the following : \nError in foo\nUnhandled exception\nException in file \"/home/emile/Documents/ymir/yruntime/midgard/core/exception.yr\", at line 38, in function \"core::exception::abort\", of type core::exception::AssertError.\nAborted (core dumped)\nA failure scope guard can evidently be attached only to scope that may\nthrow errors.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) -> i32 {\n    42\n} failure {\n    println (\"Error in foo\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (12); \n}\n\nError : failure scope guard will never be triggered\n --> main.yr:(5,3)\n    | \n 5  | } failure {\n    |   ^^^^^^^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n1.3. Exit scope\nThe exit scope is a shortcut for both success and failure scope\nguards. It guarantee that an operation will be treated at the end of a\nscope, no matter what happened in the scope.  It is very useful for\nrelease tokens or handle at the end of a scope.\nimport std::io\nimport std::concurrency::sync;\n\nstatic m = Mutex::new ()\n\ndef foo (i : i32) {\n    {\n        m.lock ();\n        assert (i  {\n            println (\"catch : \", x);\n        }\n    } exit { // even if no assertion occured this will be triggered\n        println (\"Unlock : \", i);\n        m.unlock ();\n    } \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (90);\n    foo (1);\n}\n\nResult : \nUnlock : 90\ncatch : AssertError ()\nUnlock : 1\n"}}}
