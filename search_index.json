Introduction2. Important2.1. Installation2.1.1. Native installation2.1.2. Uninstallation of the native version2.2. Docker installation1. Introduction\nYmir is a high-level, statically typed programming language\n  designed to help developers to save time by providing strong and\n  safe semantic. The semantic of this language is oriented towards\n  safety, concurrency and speed of execution. These objectives are\n  achieved thanks to its high expressiveness and its direct\n  compilation into an efficient native machine language.\nThis documentation explores the main concepts of Ymir, providing a\nset of examples that demonstrate the strengths of this new\nlanguage. It also presents an introduction to the standard library.\n2. Important\nBefore starting to discuss the language, please keep in mind that it\nis still under development and that sometimes things may not work as\nexpected. If you encounter errors that you do not understand or think\nare incorrect, please contact us at: gnu.ymir@mail.com. We look\nforward to receiving your mails!\nEven more, all contributions are very welcome, whether to improve the\ndocumentation, to propose improvements to the language or std, to the\nruntime, or even to the automatic release generation procedure. All\ncode repositories are available on\ngithub. In this documentation, known\nlimitations of the language are sometimes highlighted, and calls for\ncontribution.\n2.1. Installation\nThe reference compiler of Ymir is based on the compiler GCC,\nwhich offer strong static optimization, as well as a vast set of\nsupported target architectures.\nThere are two ways to install the gyc (Gnu Ymir Compiler), natively or by using a docker container.\n2.1.1. Native installation\nThis compiler can be installed on linux debian system, by following those simple steps: \n\nFirst, you need to downloads the packages : \n\nlibmidgard-9-dev\nGYC\n\n\nAnd then, you need to install them using dpkg : \n\n\n$ sudo dpkg -i libgmidgard_9.3.0_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i gyc-9_9.3.0_amd64.deb\n\n\nThese packages depend on : \n\ng++-9\ngcc-9-base\nlibc6 >= 2.21\nlibgmp10 >= 2:5.0.1~\nlibmpc3\nlibmpfr6 >= 3.1.3\nzlib1g >= 1:1.1.4\nlibgcc1\nzlib1g-dev\nzlib1g >= 1:1.2.0\nlibgc-dev >= 1:7.4.2\n\nIf one of them is not installed, you will get an error, that can be resolved by running the following command : \nsudo apt --fix-broken install\n\n\nAnd then reinstall the package that has previously failed (dpkg).\nThe compiler is now installed and is named gyc\n$ gyc --version\n\ngyc-9 (GCC) 9.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n\n2.1.2. Uninstallation of the native version\nAs for any debian package, the uninstall is done as follows : \n$ dpkg -r gyc-9\n$ dpkg -r libgmidgard-9-dev\n\n\nCaution The uninstallation can remove your gcc installation.\nBut you can still reinstall it easily if there is any problem, by typing : \nsudo apt install --reinstall gcc-9\n\n2.2. Docker installation\nTo start you have to install docker.\n$ sudo apt install docker.io\n\n\nThen retrieve the docker image from the repository :\n$ docker pull gnuymir/9.3.0-amd64\n\nThe compiler is now accessible via the container.\n$ docker run -t -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp gnuymir/9.3.0-amd64 --version \ngyc-9 (GCC) 9.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n\nTo make it easier to use, you can add an alias in the ~/.local/bin directory.\nFirst open the file ~/.local/bin/gyc and paste the following line :\ndocker run -t -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp gnuymir/9.3.0-amd64 $*\n\n\nMake sure, that your PATH contains the ~/.local/bindirectory, and\nthen open a new shell, and run the following commands :\n$ chmod +x ~/.local/bin/gyc\n$ gyc --version\n\ngyc (GCC) 9.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

Variables and Mutability\nVariables are declared with the keyword let. The grammar of a\nvariable declaration is presented in the following code block.\nvar_declaration := 'let' inner_var_decl (',' inner_var_decl)*\ninner_var_decl  := (decorator)* identifier (':' type)? '=' expression\ndecorator := 'mut' | 'dmut' | 'ref'\nidentifier := ('_')* [A-z] ([A-z0-9_])*\n\n\nThe declaration of a variable is composed of four parts, 1) the\nidentifier that will be used to refer to the variable in the program,\n2) the decorators, that will give a different behavior to the program\nregarding the variable, 3) a value, that sets the initial value of the\nvariable, and 4) a type, optional part of a variable declaration,\nwhich when omitted is infered from the type of the initial value of\nthe variable. Conversely, when specified the type of a variable is\nstatically checked and compared to the initial value of the variable.\n1.1. Variable type\nThe type of the variable, as presented in the introduction, is\nspecified in the variable declaration. This implies a static typing of\neach variable, whereby a variable cannot change its type during its\nlifetime. To illustrate this point, the following source code declares\na variable of type i32, and tries to put a value of type\nf32 in it. The language does not accept this behavior, and the\ncompiler returns an error.\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = 12; // 12 is a literal of type i32\n    //  ^^^ this decorator, presented in the following sub section, is not the point of this example\n\n    x = 89.0f; // 89.0f is a literal of type f32 (floating point value)\n}\n\n\nThe compiler, because the source code is not an acceptable Ymir\nprogram, will return an error. The error presented in the following\nblock, informs that the variable x of type i32, is\nincompatible with a value of type f32.\nError : incompatible types mut i32 and f32\n --> main.yr:(5,4)\n 5  ┃     x = 89.0f; // 89.0f is a literal of type f32 (floating point value)\n    ╋       ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.2. Variable mutability\nThe decorators are used to determine the behavior to adopt with the\nvariable. The keyword ref and dmut will be discussed in\nanother chapter (cf. Aliases and\nReferences). For\nthe moment, we will be focusing on the keyword mut. This keyword\nis used to define a mutable variable, whose value can be changed. A\nvariable declared without the mut keyword is declared immutable\nby default, making its value definitive.\nIn another word, if a variable is declared immutable, then it is bound\nthe a value, that will not change at any time throughout the life of\nthe variable. The idea behind default immutability is to avoid\nunwanted behavior or errors, by forcing the developpers to determine\nwhich variables are mutable with the use of a deliberately more\nverbose syntax, while making all the other variables immutable.\nIn the following source code a variable x of type i32 is\ndeclared. This variable is immutable, (as the decorator mut is\nnot used). Then the line 7, which consist in trying to modify the\nvalue of the variable x is not accepted by the language,\nthat's why the compiler does not accept to compile the program.\n\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 2;    \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x);\n}\n\n\nFor the given source file, the compiler will generate the following\nerror. This error informs that the affectation is not allowed, due to\nthe nature of the variable x, which is not mutable. In Ymir,\nvariable mutability and, type mutability ensure, through static\nchecks, that when one declares that the value of a variable will not\nchange, it will really never change. Although this can sometimes be\nfrustrating for the user. \nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(7,2)\n    ┃ \n 7  ┃     x = 3; \n    ┃     ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n \nThe above example can be modified to make the variable x\nmutable. This modification implies the use of the keyword mut,\nwhich — placed ahead of a variable declaration — makes it\nmutable. Thanks to that modification, the following source code is an\nacceptable program, and thus will be accepted by the compiler.\n\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = 2;    \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x);\n}\n\n\nResult:\nX is equal to : 2\nX is equal to : 3\n In reality, mutability is not related to variables, but to\ntypes. This language proposes a complex type mutability system, whose\nunderstanding requires the comprehension of data types beforehand. In\nthe following sections, we will, for that reason, present the type\nsystem, (and the different types of data that can be created in Ymir — cf.  chapter Data\ntypes),\nbefore coming back to the data mutability, — and have a full overview\nof the mutability system in chapter Aliases and\nreferences.\n1.3. Initial value\nA variable is always declared with a value. The objective is to\nensure that any data in the program came from somewhere, and are not\ninitialized from a random memory state of the machine executing the\nprogram (as we can have in C language). \nOne can argue, that static verification can be used to ensure that a\nvariable is set before being used, and argue that forcing an initial\nvalue to a variable is not the best way to achieve data validity.  If\nat this point, this is more a matter of opinion than of sound\nscientific reasoning, we think that scattering the initialization of a\nvariable, makes programs more difficult to read. More, immutable\nvariables would be mutable for one affectation, making the\nbehavior of a program even more difficult to grasp. \nIn the following table, is presented two examples of source code, with\nthe same behavior. On the left, a valid source code accepted by the\nYmir language, and on the right, a source code that is not accepted\nbased on the arguments we put forward. \n\n\n A \n B \n\n\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let i = if (true) {\n        42\n    } else {\n        7\n    };\n}\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let i : i32;\n    if (true) {\n        i = 42;\n    } else {\n        i = 7;\n    };\n}\n\n\n\n\nOne can note from the left\nprogram, that an if expression has a value. Value computed by\nthe result of the expression (in that case the value 42 of type\ni32). In point of fact, every expression can have a value in\nYmir, removing the limitation, introduced by the forcing of an initial\nvalue to variables.\n1.4. Global variables\nEven if global variables have a rather bad reputation for many\njustified reasons. We choose to let the possibility to define them,\nsince in spite of all, they allow some programmation paradigms that\nwould be undoable otherwise.\nGlobal variables are defined as any local variable, except that the\nkeyword let is replaced by the keyword static. The\nfollowing source code presents an utilization of an immutable global\nvariable. This example is just a showcase, as the use of an\nenumeration (cf.\nEnum)\nwould probably be more appropriate in this specific case.\nimport std::io\n\nstatic pi = 3.14159265359\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Pi value is : \", pi);\n}\n\n\nAll information presented on local variables are relevant to the case\nof global variables. Here, we are refering to static typing,\nmutability behavior, and default value initialization. No limitation\nexists on the value that can be stored inside a global variable, nor\nthere exists on the nature of the initialization. Call of functions,\nconditional expressions, class initializations, etc., nothing was left\nout.\nGlobal variables are initialized before the start of the program,\nbefore the call of the main function. To illustrate that, the\nfollowing source code, creates a global variable of type i32\ninitialized from the value of the function foo. This function\nfoo by making a call of the function println, prints a\nmessage to the console, and the main function also does it.\nimport std::io;\n\nstatic __GLOBAL__ = foo ();\n\n/**\n  * This function print the message \"foo\", and returns the value 42\n  */\ndef foo ()-> i32 {\n  println (\"foo\");\n  42\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"__GLOBAL__ = \", __GLOBAL__);\n}\n\n\nResult:\nfoo\n__GLOBAL__ = 42\n1.4.1. Initialization order\nThere is no warranty on the order of initialization of global\nvariables. This is probably, the first limitation that we can point\nout on the Ymir languages. Contribution, to allow such warranty would\nbe very welcomed, but seems unlikely to be possible when global\nvariables come from multiple modules (cf.\nModules).\nFor the moment, because it is impossible to certify the good\ninitialization of a global variable, before the start of the program, it\nis not allowed to initialize a global variable from the value of\nanother global variable. However, this verification is very limited,\nas the value of a global variable can be used inside a function, and\nthis same function used to initialize the value of another global\nvariable. In the following source code, this behavior is illustrated.\nstatic __A__ = 42;\nstatic __B__ = __A__; \nstatic __C__ = foo ();\n\ndef foo () -> i32 {\n    __A__\n}\n\nThe compiler will unfortunetaly be able to see only the dependent\ninitialization of __B__, and will let the initialization of\n__C__ from the function foo occur. Even if in that\nspecific case, the dependency appears very clearly, it may not be that\nclear when the function foo come from an external module, that\nonly provides its prototype.\n1.5. Shadowing and scope\n1.5.1. Lifetime\nThe lifetime of a variable is defined by a scope. Regrouping\nexpressions separated by semi-colons between curly brackets, a scope\nis a semantic component well known in programming languages. It has\nsome particularities in Ymir, but these particularities will be\npresented in forthcoming chapters\n(cf. Functions,\nScope\nguards)\nand are not of interest to us at this point.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    {\n        let x = 12;\n    } // x does not exists past this scope end\n    println (x);\n}\n\n\nWhen a variable is declared inside a scope and is never used during\nits lifetime the compiler returns an error. To avoid this error, the\nvariable can be named _. If it may seem useless to declare a\nvariable that is not used, it can be useful sometimes (for example\nwhen declaring function parameters of an overriden function, cf.\nClass\ninheritence).\nA variable whose name is _, is anonymus, then there is no way to\nretreive the value of this variable.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let _ = 12; // declare a anonymus variable\n}\n\n1.5.2. Shadowing\nTwo variables with the same name cannot be declared in colliding\nscopes, i.e. if a variable is declared with the name of a living\nvariable in the current scope, the program is not acceptable, and the\ncompiler returns a shadowing error. The following source code\nillustrates this point, where two variables are declared in the same\nscope with the same name x.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 1;    \n    let x = 2;    \n    { \n        let x = 3; \n    }\n}\n\n\nThe compiler returns the following error. Even the last variable in\nthe scope opened at line 4 is not authorized. Many errors can be\navoided, by simply removing this possibility. Possibility, in our\nopinion, that is not likely to bring anything of any benefit.\nError : declaration of x shadows another declaration\n --> main.yr:(3,9)\n 3  ┃     let x = 2;    \n    ╋         ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(2,9)\n    ┃  2  ┃     let x = 1;    \n    ┃     ╋         ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\nError : declaration of x shadows another declaration\n --> main.yr:(5,13)\n 5  ┃         let x = 3; \n    ╋             ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(2,9)\n    ┃  2  ┃     let x = 1;    \n    ┃     ╋         ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nGlobal variables do not create variable shadowing problems on local\nvariables. A global variable is a global symbol, and is accessible\nthrough its parent module definition (cf.\nModules). Local\nvariables on the other hand, are only accessible for the function in\nwhich they are declared. Symbol access gives the priority to local\nvariables, behavior illustrated in the following example.\nmod Main; // declaration of a module named Main\n\nimport std::io;\n\nstatic pi = 3.14159265359\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    {\n        let pi = 3;\n        assert (pi == 3); // using local pi\n    } // by closing the scope, local pi does not exist anymore\n\n    // because local pi does no longer exists\n    // global pi is accessible\n    assert (pi == 3.14159265359);\n\n    // global pi can also be accessed from its parent module\n    assert (Main::pi == 3.14159265359);\n}\n\n"},"primitives/types.html":{"url":"primitives/types.html","title":"Data types","keywords":"","body":"1.

Primitives types\nIn Ymir language, each value has a certain type of data, which\nindicates how the program must behave and how it should operate with\nthe value. Ymir is a statically typed language, which means that\nall types of all values must be known at compile time. Usually, the\ncompiler is able to infer the data types from the values, and it is\nnot necessary to specify them when declaring a variable. But\nsometimes, when it comes to the mutability of a variable or the\ninheritance of a class for example, the inference can be wrong and\nthe behavior not adapted to what you might want to do.\nTherefore, the type may be added when declaring a variable, as in the\nfollowing code.\nlet mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2];\nlet mut y = [1, 2];\n\n\nTo understand the difference between the type of x and the type\nof y, we invite you to read the chapter\nAliases and References.\nEach type has type attributes. Theses attributes are accessed using\nthe double colon operator :: on a type expression.\nlet a = i32::init;  // i32 (0)\n\n\nAll primitive types have common attributes that are listed in the\ntable below. Attributes can be surrounded by _, to avoid some\nambiguity for some types (cf.\nEnumeration). For\nexample, the attribute typeid is equivalent to __typeid__, or\n_typeid.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value of the struct, where each field are set to init if they don't have default value\n\n\ntypeid\nThe name of the type stored in a value of type [c32]\n\n\ntypeinfo\nA structure of type TypeInfo, containing information about the type\n\n\n\nAll the information about TypeInfo are presented in chapter Dynamic\ntypes.\n1.1. Typeof and Sizeof\n1) The keyword typeof retreives the type of a value at\ncompilation time. This type can be used in any context, to retreive\ntype information. For example, in a variable declaration, a function\nparameter, or return type, structure fields, etc..\nimport std::io;\n\ndef bar () -> i32 {\n    42 \n}\n\ndef foo () -> typeof (bar ()) {\n    bar ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x : typeof (foo ()) = foo ();\n\n    println (typeof (x)::typeid, \" (\", x, \")\");\n}\n\nResults: \ni32 (42)\n\n2) The keyword sizeof retreive the size of a type in bytes at\ncompilation time. It is applicable only on types, not on value, but\nthe type of a value can be retreive using the typeof\nkeyword. This size is given in a value of type usize (this\nscalar type is presented below).\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let x : usize = sizeof (i32);\n    println (x, \" \", sizeof (typeof (x)));\n}\n\nResults: (on a x86-64 arch)\n4 8\n1.2. Scalar types\nScalar types represent all types containing a single value. Ymir\nhas five primitive scalar types: integers, floating point, characters,\nbooleans, and pointers. They can have different sizes for different\npurposes.\n1.2.1. Integer types\nAn integer is a number without decimal points. There are different\ntypes of integers in Ymir, the signed one and the unsigned\none. Signed and unsigned refers to the possibility for a number to be\nnegative. Signed integer types begin with the letter i, while\nunsigned integers begin with the letter u. The following table\nlists all the different types of integers, and sorts them by memory\nsize.\n\n\n\nsize\nsigned\nunsigned\n\n\n\n\n8 bits\ni8\nu8\n\n\n16 bits\ni16\nu16\n\n\n32 bits\ni32\nu32\n\n\n64 bits\ni64\nu64\n\n\narch\nisize\nusize\n\n\n\nThe usize and isize types are architecture dependent, and have the\nsize of a pointer, depending on the architecture targeted.\nEach type of signed integer can store values ranging from -(2\nn - 1) to 2 n - 1 - 1, where n is the size\nof the integer in memory. Unsigned types, on the other hand, can store\nnumbers ranging from 0 to 2 n - 1. For example, type\ni8, can store values from -128 to 127, and type u8 can\nstore values from 0 to 255.\nYou can write an integer in two forms, decimal 9_234 and hexadecimal\n0x897A. The _ token, is simply ignored in a literal integer.\nTo make sure a literal value has the right type, a prefix can be added\nat the end of it. For example, to get a i8 with the value 7,\nthe right literal is written 7i8. By default, if no prefix is added\nat the end of the literal, the language defines its type as a\ni32.\nAs indicated above, each type has attributes, the following table\nlists the integer-specific attributes:\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nmax\nThe maximal value\n\n\nmin\nThe minimal value\n\n\n\nAn overflow check is performed on literals at compilation time, and an\nerror is returned by the compiler if the type of integer choosed to\nencode the literal is not large enough to contain the value. For\nexample:\ndef main () {\n    let x : i8 = 934i8;\n}\n\nBecause a i8 can only store value ranging from -127 to 128, the\nvalue 934 would not fit. For that reason the compiler returns the\nfollowing error.\nError : overflow capacity for type i8 = 943\n --> main.yr:(12,18)\n    ┃ \n12  ┃     let x : i8 = 943i8;\n    ┃                  ^^^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nWARNING However, if the value cannot be known at compile time, the\noverflow is not checked and can lead to strange behavior. For example,\nif you try to add 1 to a variable of type i16 that contains the\nvalue 32767, the result will be -32768. Contribution: Provide a\ndynamic way to verify the overflow of arithmetic operation (at least\nin debug mode).\n1.2.2. Floating-point types\nFloating-point types, refer to numbers with a decimal\npart. Ymir provides two types of floating point numbers, f32\nand f64, which have a size of 32 bits and 64 bits respectively.\nYou can add the prefix f, at the end of a literal floating point\nto specify that you want a f32, instead of a f64 as it is\nby default.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 1.0; \n    let y : f32 = 1.0f;\n}\n\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to floating point\ntypes.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value - nan\n\n\nmax\nThe maximal finite value that this type can encode\n\n\nmin\nThe minimal finite value that this type can encode\n\n\nnan\nThe value Not a Number\n\n\ndig\nThe number of decimal digit of precision\n\n\ninf\nThe value positive infinity\n\n\nepsilon\nThe smallest increment to the value 1\n\n\nmant_dig\nNumber of bits in the  mantissa\n\n\nmax_10_exp\nmaximum int value such that 10max_10_exp10^{max\\_10\\_exp}10​max_10_exp​​ is representable\n\n\nmax_exp\nmaximum int value such that 2max_exp−12^{max\\_exp-1}2​max_exp−1​​ is representable\n\n\nmin_10_exp\nminimum int value such that 10min_10_exp10^{min\\_10\\_exp}10​min_10_exp​​ is representable as a normalized value\n\n\nmin_exp\nminimum int value such that 2min_exp−12^{min\\_exp-1}2​min_exp−1​​ is representable as a normalized value\n\n\n\n1.2.3. Boolean type\nA boolean is a very simple type that can take two values, either true or false.  For example:\ndef main () {\n    let b = true;\n    let f : bool = false;\n}\n\n\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to boolean type.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value - false\n\n\n\n1.2.4. Character type\nThe c8 and c32 are the types used to encode the\ncharacters.  As with literal integers, it is necessary to add a prefix\nto define the type of a literal. The prefix used to specify the type\nof a literal character is c8, if nothing is specified, the\ncharacter type will be c32.\nThe c32 character has a size of four bytes and can store any\nunicode value.  Literal characters can have two forms, and are always\nsurrounded by the token '. The first form is the character\nitself, and the second is the unicode value in the integer\nform \\u{12} or \\u{0xB}.\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺';    \n    let y = '\\u{0x263A}';\n}\n\nIf the loaded literal is too long to be stored in the character type,\nan error will be returned by the compiler. For example :\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺'c8; \n}\n\nThe error will be the following. This error means that you will need\nat least 3 c8 to store the value, so it doesn't fit into one\nc8 :\nError : malformed literal, number of c8 is 3\n --> main.yr:(2,10)\n    | \n 2  |     let x = '☺'c8; \n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to character types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value - \\u{0}\n\n\n\n1.2.5. Pointers\nPointer are values that stores an address of memory. They can be used\nto store the location of a data in memory. In Ymir, pointers are\nconsidered low level programming and are mainly used in the std, and\nruntime to interface with machine level semantics. You can perfectly\nwrite any program without needing pointers, and for that reason we\nrecomand to not use them.\nPointers are defined using the & keyword on types, or on\nvalues. They are aliasable types, as they borrow memory (cf Aliasable\nand\nReferences).\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &SegFault, &AssertError\n{\n    let mut i = 12;\n    let p : &i32 = &i; // creation of a pointer on i\n    i = 42;\n    assert (*p == 42); // dereference the pointer and access the value\n}\n\n\nPointers are unsafe, and dereferencing a pointer can result in undefined\nbehavior depending on where it points. It can also sometimes raise a\nsegmentation fault. In Ymir, segmentation fault are recovered,\nand an exception is thrown. Error handling is presented in chaper\nError\nHandling.\nWARNING, Note that the segmentation fault may not occur even if\n  the pointer is not properly set. The easiest way to avoid undefined\n  behavior is to not use pointers and use std verified functions, or\n  other semantically verified elements (cf Aliasable and\n  References).\n\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to pointer types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninner\nThe type of the inner value - for example : i32 for &i32\n\n\n\n1.3. Compound types\nUnlike scalar types, the compound contains multiple values.  There are\nthree types of compounds: the tuple, the range and the arrays.\n1.3.1. Tuple\nA tuple is a set of values of different types. Tuples have a fixed\narity. The arity of a tuple is defined at compilation time, and\nrepresent the number of values contained inside the tuple. Each\nelement of a tuple has a type, and a given order. Tuples are built\nbetween parentheses, by a comma-separated list of values. A tuple of\none value can be defined, by putting a coma after the first\nvalue. This way the compiler can understand the desire of creating a\ntuple, and do not confuse it with a normal expression between\nparentheses.\ndef main () {\n    let t : (i32, c32, f64) = (1, 'r', 3.14);  // three value tuple\n    let t2 : (i32,) = (1,); // single value tuple\n    let t3 : i32 = (1); // single value of type i32\n}\n\n\nThe tuple t, is a single element, and can be used as a function\nparameter or as a return value of a function. It can also be\ndestructured, to retrieve the values of its component elements. There\nare three ways of tuple destructuring.\n1) the dot operator ., followed by an integer value, whose value\nis known at compilation time. This value can be computed by a complex\nexpression, as long as the compiler is able to retreive the value at\ncompilation time (cf. Compilation time\nexecution).\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let z : i32 = t._0;\n    let y : c32 = t. (0 + 1); \n    println (t.2);\n}\n\n\n2) the tuple destructuring syntax. This syntax, close to variable\ndeclaration, creates new variables that contains parts of the tuple\nthat is destructured. In the following example, one can note that the\ntuple destructuring syntax allows to extract only some of the tuple\nvalues. The type of the variable e is the tuple (c32,\nf64), and its values are ('r', 3.14), when the variable\nf contains the value 1 of type i32.\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let (x, y, z) = t;\n\n    let (f, e...) = t;\n    println (f, \" \", e.0);\n}\n\n\n3) the keyword expand. this keyword is a compile-time rewrite,\nthat expands the values of a tuple into a list of values. This list is\nthen used to create other tuples, call functions, etc. The following\nexample shows the use of the keyword expand to call a function\ntaking two parameters, with the value of a tuple containing two\nvalues. \nimport std::io\n\ndef add (a : i32, b : i32) -> i32 \n    a + b\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (1, 2);\n    println (add (expand x)); \n\n    // Will be rewritten into :     \n    println (add (x.0, x.1));\n\n    // rewritter into : (1, x.0, x.1)\n    let j : (i32, i32, i32) = (1, expand x);    \n}\n\n\nThere is two other ways to destructurate a tuple. These ways are\npresented in forthcoming chapters. The following table lists the\nattributes specific to tuple types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\narity\nThe number of elements contained in the tuple (in a u32)\n\n\ninit\na tuple, where each element values are set to init\n\n\n\n1.3.2. Ranges\nRanges are types that contain two values defining a range. A range is\nnamed r!T, where T is the type of the range limits. They\nare created by the token .. and .... A range consists of\nfour values, which are stored in the fields shown in the following\ntable. These fields can be accessed using the dot operator .. \n\n\n\nname\ntype\nvalue\n\n\n\n\nfst\nT\nthe first bound\n\n\nscd\nT\nthe second bound\n\n\nstep\nmut T\nthe step of the interval\n\n\ncontain\nbool\nIs the scd bound contained in the interval ?\n\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let range : r!(i32) = 1 .. 8;     \n    let c_range : r!(i32) = 1 ... 8;\n}\n\nThe step_by function takes a range as a parameter and returns a\nnew range, with a modified step.\ndef main () { \n    let range = (1 .. 8).step_by (2); \n}\n\nThe Control\nflows\nsection shows a use of these types.\n1.3.3. Arrays\nAn array is a collection of values of the same type, stored in\ncontiguous memory.  Unlike tuples, the size of an array is unknown at\ncompile time, and in Ymir, they are similar to slices, and will be\nrefered as such. Slices are defined with a syntax close to the one of\ntuple, but with brackets instead of parentheses, for example [1, 2, 3]. \nThe type of a slice is also defined using the brackets, for example [i32], meaning a slice containing i32 values.\nString literals, enclosed between double quotes are a special case of\nslice literals. There is no string type in Ymir, but only slices\ntype. Because of this, string values are typed [c32] or\n[c8] depending on the type of values contained in the\nslice. String literals can be prefixed with the keyword s8 or\ns32 to define the encoding system used. By default, when no\nprefix is specified a string literal have a type [c32]. \nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () { \n    let x = [1, 2, 3]; // a [i32] slice\n    let y = \"Hello World !!\"; // a [c32] slice\n    let z = \"Hello World !!\"s8; // a [c8] slice\n}\n\n\nWarning: The length of a [c8] literals can seem incorrect\ndue to the encoding system. For example, the slice \"☺\"s8 will have a\nlength of 3. To summarize, [c8] slices are utf-8 encoded\nstring literals, when [c32] are encoded in utf-32.\nA slice is a two-word object, the first word is the length of the\nslice, and the second is a pointer to the data stored in the slice. A\nslice is an aliasable type, its mutability is a bit more complicated\nthan the mutability of scalar types, because it borrows memory which\nis not automatically copied when an assignment is made. This section\nwill not discuss the mutability of internal types or aliasable\ntypes. This is discussed in the chapter Aliases and\nReferences.\nThe field len records the length of the slice and can be\nretrieved with the dot operator ..  The length of the slice is\nstored in a usize field.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n   let x = [1, 2, 3];\n   println (\"The value of x : \", x); \n   println (\"The length of x : \", x.len);\n}\n\nSimilarly, the ptr field, gives access to the pointer of the\nslice and its types depend on the inner type of the slice, and is\nnever mutable. Pointer type are absolutely not important for a\nYmir program, and we suspect that you will never have use of\nthem. They are defined to allow low level programming paradigms, and\nare used in the std and runtime. \nTo access the elements of an array, the [] operator is used. It\ntakes either an integer value or a range value as parameter. If a\nrange value is given, a second slice that borrows a section of the\nfirst is created. For now, the step of the range does not affect the\nborrowing of the array. A contribution can be made here. On the other\nhand if an integer value i is given as parameter, the value at\nthe index i is returned.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray \n{\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let y = x [0 .. 2];\n    let z = x [0];\n\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z); \n}\n\n\nThe length of a slice is unknown at compilation time, and access can\nbe made with dynamic integers whose values are also unknown at\ncompilation time. For that reason, it may happen that the parameters\nused go beyond the slice length. With this in mind, slice access is\nconsidered unsafe, and can throw an exception of type\n&OutOfArray. The exception system, and error handling is\ndetailed in the chapter Error\nHandling.\nSlices can be concatenated, to form another slice. The concatenation\nis made using the operator tilde on two operands. To work properly and\nbe accepted by the language, the two slice used as operands must share\nthe same type (but not necessarily mutability level, the mutability of\nthe operand with the lowest mutability level is choosed for the result\nof the operation cf. Aliases and\nReferences).\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> [i32] {\n    [8, 7, 6]\n}\n\ndef main ()  {\n    println ([1, 2, 3] ~ foo ());\n}\n\nThe tilde token was chosen to avoid some ambiguity. In some languages\nsuch as Java, the concatenation is made using the token + that\nsometimes creates some ambiguity when concatenating strings, and other\nelements such as integers. For example, the expression \"foo\" + 1 + 2, is ambiguous. \nOne can note however, that since concatenation only works on slices of\nthe same type, the following expression \"foo\" ~ 2, is invalid as\n\"foo\" is of type [c32], and 2 of type i32.\nAnother syntax can be used to create slices. This syntax called slice\nallocation, allocates a slice on the heap and set the same value to\nevery element of the slice.\nimport std::io\nimport std::random;\n\ndef main () {\n    let a : [i32] = [0 ; new 100u64]; // this avoids the write of 100 zeros\n                                      // but the result is the same\n\n    let b = [12 ; new uniform (10, 100)]; \n    //                ^^^^^^^ generates a random value between 10 and 100\n    println (a, \" \", b);\n}\n\n\nThe following table lists the attributes specific to slice types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninner\nthe inner type\n\n\ninit\nan empty slice (with len == 0us)\n\n\n\n1.3.4. Static Arrays\nUnlike the slice, static arrays are stored in the stack rather than on\nthe heap. To be possible, their size must be known at compilation\ntime. The syntax used to create a static array is close to the syntax\nof a slice allocation, but the keyword new omitted.\nimport std::io\n\n/**\n  * Takes an array of size twelve as parameter\n  */\ndef foo (a : [i32 ; 12]) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    let mut a : [mut i32 ; 12] = [0 ; 12];\n\n    for i in 0 .. 12\n        a [i] = i\n\n    let b = [1; 12];\n\n    foo (a);\n    foo (b);\n}\n\nA static array can be transformed into a slice using the alias,\ncopy and dcopy keywords.

Functions\nFunction is a widely accepted concept for dividing a program into\nsmall parts. A Ymir program starts with the main function that\nyou have already seen in previous chapters. All functions are declared\nusing the keyword def followed by a identifier, and a list of\nparameters. A function is called by using its identifier followed by a\nlist of parameters separated by commas between parentheses.\nimport std::io \n\n/** \n * The main function is the entry point of the program\n * It can have no parameters, and return an i32, or void\n */\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\n\n/** \n * Declaration of a function named 'foo' with no parameters \n */\ndef foo () {\n    println (\"Foo\");\n\n    bar (); \n}\n\n\n/**\n * Declaration of a function named 'bar' with one parameter 'x' of type 'i32'\n*/\ndef bar (x : i32) {\n    println (\"Bar \", x);\n}\n\n\nThe grammar of a function is defined in the following code block.\nfunction := template_function | simple_function\nsimple_function := 'def' identifier parameters ('->' type)? expression\ntemplate_function := 'def' ('if' expression) identifier templates parameters ('->' type)? expression\n\nparameters := '(' (var_decl (',' var_decl)*)? ')'\nvar_decl := identifier ':' type ('=' expression)?\n\nidentifier := ('_')* [A-z] ([A-z0-9_])*\n\n\nThe order of declaration of the symbol has no impact on the\ncompilation. The symbols are defined by the compiler before being\nvalidated, thus contrary to C-like languages, even if the foo\nfunction is defined after the main function, it's symbol is\naccessible, and hence callable by the main function. Further\ninformation about symbol declarations, and accesses are presented in\nchapter\nModules.\n1.1. Parameters\nThe parameters of a function are declared after its identifier between\nparentheses. The syntax of declaration of a parameter is similar to\nthe syntax of declaration of a variable, except that the keyword\nlet is omitted. However, unlike variable declaration, a\nparameter must have a type, and its value is optional.\nimport std::io \n\n/**\n * Declaration of a function 'foo' with one parameter 'x' of type 'i32'\n */\ndef foo (x : i32) {\n    println (\"The value of x is : \", x);\n}\n\n/**\n * Declaration of a function 'bar' with two parameters 'x' and 'y' whose respective types are 'i32' and 'i32'\n */\ndef bar (x : i32, y : i32) {\n    println (\"The value of x + y : \", x + y);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (5); // Call the function 'foo' with 'x' set to '5'\n    bar (3, 4); // Call the function 'bar' with 'x' set to '3' and 'y' set to '4'\n}\n\n\n1.1.1. Default value\nA function parameter can have a value, that is used by default when\ncalling the function. Therefore it is optional to specify the value of\na function parameter that have a default value, when calling it. To\nchange the value of a parameter with a default value, the named\nexpression syntax is used. This expression, whose grammar is\npresented in the following code block, consists in naming a value.\nnamed_expression: Identifier '->' expression\n\nThe following source code presents an example of function with a\nparameter with a default value, and the usage of a named expression to\ncall this function.\nimport std::io\n\n\n// Function 'foo' can be called without specifying a value for parameter 'x'\n// '8' will be used as a default value for 'x'\n//\ndef foo (x : i32 = 8) {\n    println (\"The value of x is : \", x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (); // call 'foo' with 'x' set to '8'\n    foo (x-> 7); // call 'foo' with 'x' set to '7'\n}\n\n\nThe named expression can also be used for parameters without any\ndefault value. Thanks to that named expression, it is possible to\nspecify the parameter in any order.\nimport std::io\n\n\n/**\n * Parameters with default values, does not need to be last parameters\n * This function can be called with only two parameters (x, z), or using named expression syntax\n */\ndef foo (x : i32, y : i32 = 9, z : i32) {\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    // Call the 'foo' function with 'x' = 2, 'y' = 1 and 'z' = 8 \n    foo (8, y-> 1, x-> 2);\n    foo (1, 8); // call the function 'foo' with 'x' = 1 and y = '9' and z = '8'\n}\n\nResults:\n2 1 8\n1 9 8\n\nAny complex expression for the default value of a function parameter\ncan be used. The creation of an object, a call of a function, a code\nblock, etc. The only limitation is that, you cannot refer to the other\nparameters of the function. Indeed, they are not considered declared\nin the scope of the default value.\ndef foo (x : i32) -> i32 { ... }\ndef bar (x : i32) -> i32 { ... }\n\n/**\n * Declaration of a 'baz' function, where 'b' = bar(1) + foo(2), as a default value\n */\ndef baz (a : i32, b : i32 = {bar (1) + foo (2)}) {\n // ...\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    baz (12);\n}\n\n\nThe symbols used in the default value of a parameters must be\naccessible in the context of the function declaration. In the last\nexample, that means that the function baz must know the function\nbar and the function foo, however, there is no need for the\nfunction that calls it (here the function main) to know these\nsymbols. Further explanation on symbol declarations and accesses are\npresented in chapter\nModules.\n1.1.2. Recursive default value\n\nRecursivity of default parameter is prohibited. To illustrate this\npoint, the following code example will not be accepted by the\ncompiler.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (foo_a : i32 = bar ()) -> i32 {\n                    // ^^^ here there is a recursive call \n    foo_a\n}\n\ndef bar (bar_a : i32 = foo ()) -> i32 {\n                    // ^^^ recursivity problem\n\n    println (\"Bar \", bar_a);\n    foo (foo_a-> bar_a + 11) \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Main \", bar ()); // no need to set bar_a\n}\n\nErrors:\nError : the call operator is not defined for main::bar and {}\n --> main.yr:(3,28)\n 3  ┃ def foo (foo_a : i32 = bar ()) -> i32 {\n    ╋                            ^^\n    ┃ Note : candidate bar --> main.yr:(8,5) : main::bar (bar_a : i32)-> i32\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(3,10)\n    ┃  3  ┃ def foo (foo_a : i32 = bar ()) -> i32 {\n    ┃     ╋          ^^^^^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(8,24)\n    ┃  8  ┃ def bar (bar_a : i32 = foo ()) -> i32 {\n    ┃     ╋                        ^^^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(8,10)\n    ┃  8  ┃ def bar (bar_a : i32 = foo ()) -> i32 {\n    ┃     ╋          ^^^^^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(3,24)\n    ┃  3  ┃ def foo (foo_a : i32 = bar ()) -> i32 {\n    ┃     ╋                        ^^^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━\n\n\nThis recursivity problem can be easily resolved by setting a value to\nthe parameter bar_a when called in the default value of\nfoo_a.\ndef foo (foo_a : i32 = bar (bar_a-> 20)) -> i32 {\n                    //      ^^^^^ resolve the recursive problem \n    foo_a\n}\n\n// no need to do the same in bar, the recursivity does not exists anymore\n\nResults:\nBar 20\nBar 31\nMain 42\n1.1.3. Main function parameters\nThe main function can have a parameter. This parameter is of\ntype [[c8]], and is the list of arguments passed to the program\nin the command line when called. \nimport std::io;\n\ndef main (args : [[c8]]) {\n    println (args);\n}\n\nResults: \n$ ./a.out foo bar 1\n[./a.out, foo, bar, 1]\n\nThe std provides an argument parser in std::args, that will not\nbe presented here, but worth mentioning.\n1.2. Function body\nThe body of a function is an expression. Every expression in Ymir are\ntyped, but that does not mean that every expression have a value, as\nthey can be typed as void expression. A simple add function\ncan be written as follows:\ndef add (x : i32, y : i32)-> i32 \n    x + y\n\n\nOr by using a more complex expression, such as scope, which is an\nexpression containing a list of expression. A scope is surrounded by\nthe curly brackets, and was presented in the section regarding\nlifetime of local variables. The last expression in the list of\nexpression of a scope, is taken as the value of the scope. \n\ndef add (x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 { // start of a block\n    x + y // last expression of the block is the value of the block\n} // end of a block\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = {\n        let y = add (1, 2);\n        y + 8 \n    }   \n}\n\n\nThe semi-colon token ; is a way of specifying that an expression\nends inside a scope, and that its value must be ignored. If the last\nexpression of a scope is terminated by a semi-colon, an empty\nexpression is added to the scope. This empty expression has no value,\ngiving to the scope an empty value of type void as well.\n\n// The value of foo is '9'\n//\ndef foo () -> i32 \n    9\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = {\n         foo (); // Call foo, but its value is ignored\n    } // The value of the scope is 'void'\n}\n\n\nBecause it is impossible to declare a variable with a void type, that\ncontains no value, the above example is no accepted by the\nlanguage. The compiler returns the error depicted below. One can note,\nthat it is however possible the declare a variable without value, but\nits type must be an empty tuple, defined by the literal ().\nError : cannot declare var of type void\n --> main.yr:(6,9)\n    | \n 6  |     let x = {\n    |         ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.3. Function return type\nWhen the value of the body of a function is not of type void,\nthe function has as well a value with a type. This type must be\ndefined in the prototype of the function, to be visible from the other\nfunction that can call it. This type declaration is made with the\nsingle arrow token -> after the declarations of the parameter of\nthe function. The return type of a function can be omitted if the\nvalue of its body is of type void, but must be specified\notherwise.\ndef foo (x : i32)-> i32 \n    x + 1\n\ndef bar (x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 {\n    let z = x + y;\n    println (\"The value of z : \", z);\n    foo (z)\n}\n\n\nIt is not always convinient to define a body of a function in a way\nthat leads to return the right value, when many branches are\npossible. To avoid verbosity, and return function prematuraly, the\nkeyword return, close a function and return the value of the\nexpression associated with it. This return statement can also be\nused in a void function, if its expression is of type\nvoid. The type of the value of the expression associated to the\nreturn statement must be the same as the function return type\ndefined in its prototype.\ndef isDivisable (x : i32, z : i32) -> bool {\n    if (z == 0) return false; \n\n    (x % z) == 0\n}\n\n\nThe compiler checks that every branches leads to a return statement or\nto a value of the right type. If a function body has a type different\nto the return type of the function, and it can happen that no return\nstatement is encountered, then the compiler returns an error.\nimport std::io\n\ndef add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    x + 1; // the value of the block is void, due to the ';'\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = add_one (5); \n    println (\"The value of x : \", x);\n}\n\n\nIn the above source code, the function add_one has a body of type\nvoid, when the function prototype claims that the function\nreturns a i32, and no return statement can be encountered inside\nthe function, thus the compiler returns the following error.  \nError : incompatible types i32 and void\n --> main.yr:(3,29)\n 3  ┃ def add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    ╋                             ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(5,1)\n    ┃  5  ┃ }\n    ┃     ╋ ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.4. Scope declaration\nA scope is also the opening of a local module, in which declaration\ncan be made. These declarations can be other functions, structures,\nclasses, enumeration, etc. The declarations made inside a scope have\nno access to the local variables defined in the function. Such access\nis possible with the use of closures (cf. Function\nadvanced),\nbut this is not be presented inside this chapter.\ndef foo () {\n    import std::io;     // importation is local to foo\n    let x = 12;\n    {\n        def bar () -> i32 {\n            // Try to add the following line \n            // println (x);\n            12\n        }\n        println (x + bar ());\n    }\n\n    // bar is no longer accessible\n    // bar (); // will not compile\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n\n    // Try to add the following lines : \n    // bar ();\n    // println (\"In the main function !\");\n}\n\n\nIn the above example, the bar function is available in the scope\nopened at line 4, until its end at line 11. For that reason,\nit is also not available inside the main function. Moreover, the\nimport statement made at line 2 (importing the println\nfunction) is only available in the scope opened at line 1, and for\nthat reason not available in the main function. Functions are\nnot modules, this way of defining is used to define private symbols\nonly, in a future chapter we will see a way to define public symbols\navailable for other functions, and foreign modules (cf.\nModules).\n1.5. Uniform call syntax\nThe uniform call syntax is a syntax that allows to call a function\nwith the dot operator .. The uniform call syntax places the\nfirst parameter of the function at the left of the dot\noperation, and the rest of the arguments of the function after the\nright operand as a list of expressions separated by comas enclosed\ninside parentheses. \nufc := expression '.' expression '(' (expression (',' expression)*)? ')'\n\nThis syntax is used to perform continuous data processing and to make\nthe source code easier to read. This syntax is named uniform call\nsyntax because it is similar to the the syntax used to call methods\non class objects\n(cf. Objects);\nimport std::io\n\ndef plusOne (i : i32) -> i32 \n    i + 1\n\ndef plusTwo (i : i32) -> i32\n    i + 2\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 12;\n    x.plusOne ()\n     .plusTwo ()\n     .println ();          \n}\n\nResults:\n15\n\nThe uniform call syntax can also be useful to define equivalent of\nmethods on structures. \n"},"primitives/control.html":{"url":"primitives/control.html","title":"Control flows","keywords":"","body":"1.

Control flows\nWhen writing a program, the ability to decide to execute part of the\ncode conditionally, or to repeat part of the code, is a basic scheme\nthat is necessary. \n2. If expression\nAn if expression is a control flow allowing to branch into the\nprogram code by making decisions based on conditions. An else can be\nplaced after an if expression, to execute a part of code, if the\ncondition of the if expression is not met. The syntax of the if\nexpression is presented in the following code block.\nif_expression := 'if' expression expression ('else' expression)?\n\n\nThe following source code present a basic utilization of the if expression. \ndef main () {\n    let x = 5;\n\n    if x \n\nThe value of an if expression is computed by the block of code that\nis executed when branching on the condition. Each branch of the\nif expression must have a value of the same type, otherwise an\nerror is returned by the compiler. The value of an if, can of\ncourse be of type void.\ndef main () {\n    let condition = true;\n    let x = if condition {\n        5 \n    } else {\n        7\n    };\n}\n\n\nIf there is a possibility for the program to enter none of the branch\nof the if expression, then the value of the whole if expression is\nof type void. For example, in the following source code, the\nvariable condition can be either true or false, leading to\nthe possibility for the if expression defined at line 5 to be\nnever entered, and to the possibility for that the value of x to\nbe never set.\ndef foo () -> bool { // ... } // return a bool value\n\ndef main () {\n    let condition = foo ();\n    let x = if condition { // the condition can be false\n        5 \n    }; // and then the expression has no value\n       // but the variable x cannot be of type void\n}\n\nErrors: \nError : incompatible types void and i32\n --> main.yr:(5,10)\n 5  ┃     let x = if condition { // the condition can be false\n    ╋             ^^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(6,3)\n    ┃  6  ┃         5 \n    ┃     ╋         ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n2.1. Loops\nIn Ymir, there are three kinds of loops: loop, while and for.\n2.1.1. Infinite repetitions\nThe keyword loop is used to specify that a scope must be\nrepeated endlessly. The syntax of the loop expression is the\nfollowing:\nloop_expression := 'loop' expression\n\n\nIn the following example, the program will never exit, and will print,\nan infinite number of times, the string \"I will be printed an infinite\nnumber of times\".\ndef main () {\n    loop { // the loop will never exit\n         println (\"I will be printed an infinite number of times\");\n    }\n}\n\n\nA loop can be used to repeat an action until it succeeds, e.g. waiting\nfor the end of a thread, or waiting for incoming network connections,\netc.  The keyword break is used to stop a loop. A break\nstatement is associated with a value, which is following the\nkeyword. The value of a loop is defined by the value given by the\nbreak statement. Every break statement in a loop must share the\nsame type. A loop can evidently be of type void.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut counter = 0;\n\n    let result = loop { \n        counter += 1;\n        if counter == 10 {\n            break counter + 1; // stop the loop and set its value to 'counter + 1'\n        }\n    };\n    println (\"Result : \", result);\n}\n\nResults:\nResult : 11\n\n2.1.2. Loop while condition is met\nThe keyword while creates a loop, which repeats until a\ncondition is no longer satisfied. As for the loop, it can be broken\nwith the keyword break. Unlike loop the value of a while loop\nis always of type void, because it is impossible to ensure that\nthe while is entered at all. The break statement must follow that\nrule, and break only with values of type void. \nwhile_expression := 'while' expression expression\n\n\nContribution:\nIt is planned to add the possibility to write an else after a while\nloop to give a value to the while loop when it is not entered.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut i = 0;\n    while i \nResults:\nI is : 10\n\n2.1.3. Iterate over a value\nThe last type of loop is the for loop defined with the keyword\nfor. Like for the while loop the value of a for loop is\nalways void as it is impossible to garantee that the loop is\nentered even once. The for loop iterates over an iterable\ntype. Primitive iterable types are ranges, tuple, slices and static\narrays.\nfor_expression := 'for' ('(' var_decls ')' | var_decls) 'in' expression expression\n\nvar_decls := var_decl (',' var_decl)\nvar_decl := (decorator)* identifier (':' type)?\n\ndecorator := 'ref' | 'mut' | 'dmut'\n\n \n1) Iteration over a range. In the following example, the for loop is\nused to iterate over two ranges. The first loop at line 4,\niterates between 0 and 8 (not included), by a step of\n2. When the second loop iterate between the value 10 and 0\n(not included) with a step of -1.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    for i in (0 .. 8).step_by (2) {\n        println (i);\n    }    \n\n    for i in 10 .. 0 {\n        println (i, \"!\");\n    }\n}\n\n\n2) iteration over slices and static arrays. Slices are iterable\ntypes. They can be iterated using one or two variables. When only one\nvariable is used, it is associated with the values contained inside\nthe slice. When two variable are used, the first variable is\nassociated to the current iteration index, and the second variable to\nthe values contained inside the slice. Static array iteration works\nthe same.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = [10, 11, 12];\n    for i in a {\n        print (i, \" \");\n    }\n\n    println (\"\");\n    for i, j in a {\n        print (i, \"-> \", j, \" \");\n    }\n    println (\"\");\n}\n\nResults:\n10 11 12 \n0-> 10 1-> 11 2-> 12\n\nContribution: the iteration by reference over mutable slice, and\nmutable static arrays is currently under development.\n3) iteration over tuples. Tuple are iterable types. But unlike slice,\nor range the for loop is evaluated at compilation time. The tuple\ncan be iterated using only one variable, that is associated to the\nvalues contained inside the tuple.\nimport std::io \n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (1, 'r');\n    for i in x { \n        println (i);\n    }\n\n    // Is equivalent to \n    println (x.0);\n    println (x.1);\n}\n\n\nOne may note that the type of the variable i in the for loop\nof the above example changes from one iteration to another, being of\ntype i32 at first iteration and then of type c32. For that\nreason, the for loop is not really dynamic, but flattened at\ncompilation time. This does not change anything from a user\nperspective, but is worth mentioning, to avoid miscomprehension of\nstatic type system, there is no hidden dynamicity here.\n"},"advanced/":{"url":"advanced/","title":"Alias and References","keywords":"","body":"1.

Alias and References\nThe alias and reference is one of the most important characteristics\nof the Ymir language, which allows it to give guarantees on the\nmutability of the data, and the explicit movement of the memory. It is\nimportant to understand how memory works in Ymir, in order to\nunderstand the error message you might get when you try to move data\nfrom one variable to another.\nIt is important to understand that Ymir is a high level\nprogramming language, and that you will never have to worry about\nmemory management (memory leaks), the language using a garbage\ncollector. However, in terms of mutability and access rights, the\nlanguage provides an expressive system for managing memory movements.\n1.1. Standard and Aliasable types\nIn Ymir, there are two types, standard types and aliasable\ntypes. A value whose type is a standard type, can be copied without\nthe need of explicitly inform the compiler. The standard types are all\nprimitive scalar types. On the other hand, aliasable types are types\nthat have borrowed data, which will not be copied unless it is\nexplicitly written into the code, to avoid performance loss.\nTo understand how data is represented in a program, you need to know\nthe difference between heap and stack. The stack is a space allocated\nby the program when a function is entered, which is released when the\nfunction is exited. On the other hand, the heap is a space that is\nallocated when certain instructions in the program require it, such as\nallocating a new slice, allocating  a new object instance, and so on.\nWhen a slice is allocated, all its data is stored in the heap, and the\naddress of this data is stored in the stack, where the variables are\nlocated. The following figure shows the data representation for this\nprogram:\ndef foo () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n}\n\n\n\n1.2. Mutability level\nWe define the level of mutability as the deepest level of the type\nthat is mutable. An example of a mutability level is shown in the\nfollowing table:\n\n\n\nType\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nmut [i32]\n1\n\n\n[i32]\n0\n\n\nmut [mut i32]\n2\n\n\ndmut [[[i32]]]\n4\n\n\n\nThis is mainly used to ensure that the borrowed data is not changed by\nanother variable in a foreign part of the program. The users have full\ncontrol over the data they have created. The example below shows\nhow the mutability level is used to ensure that the content of a\ntable is never changed.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    let mut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    x = [2, 3, 4];\n\n    x [0] = 8;\n}\n\n\nThe type of x in the above example is mut [i32]. The\nmutability of the internal part of the slice (i32 value) is not\nspecified. The compiler, for security reasons, infered it as\nimmutable. The line 5 of the previous example is accepted, because\nthe variable x is mutable, however, the value pointed by the\nslice contained in x is not. For that reason the line 9 is\nnot accepted and the compiler returns the following error.\nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(7,7)\n 7  ┃     x [0] = 8;\n    ╋       ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nIf the mutability level defines the write permission of every data, it\nis assumed that every parts of the code that have access to a give\nvalue have read permission on it. For that reason, in the previous\nexample, even if writting into x [0] is not permitted, reading\nits value is allowed.\n1.2.1. Deep mutability\nEarlier we introduced the keyword dmut, this keyword is used to\navoid a very verbose type statement, and defines that every subtype\nare mutable. This keyword is applicable to all types, but will only\nhave a different effect from the mut decorator on aliasable\ntypes. The following table gives an example of an slice type, using\nthe keyword dmut :\n\n\n\nType\nVerbose equivalent\n\n\n\n\ndmut [i32]\nmut [mut i32]\n\n\ndmut [[[i32]]]\nmut [mut [mut [mut i32]]]\n\n\n\nIf we come back to our previous example, and change the type of the\nvariable x, and use the keyword dmut. The variable x\nnow borrows mutable datas, that can be modified, thus the expression\nat line 9 is accepted.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    x = [2, 3, 4];\n\n    x [0] = 8;\n}\n\n1.2.2. Const keyword\nThe const keyword is the perfect opposite of the dmut\nkeyword. This keyword has no interest when defining types directly\n(because they are immutable by default), but coupled with the keyword\ntypeof, it can transform a mutable type into a immutable type.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = 12;\n    println (typeof (x)::typeid);\n    println ((const typeof (x))::typeid);\n}\n\nResults:\nmut i32\ni32\n1.2.3. String literal\nStrings literal, unlike slice literals, are in the text segment of the\nprogram (read-only part of a program). This means that the type of a\nliteral string is [c32] (or [c8] if the suffix s8 is\nspecified), while the type of a literal array (of i32 for example)\nis mut [mut i32]. For that reason, it impossible to borrow the\ndata into a deeply mutable variable.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut x = \"Try to make me mutable !?\";\n}\n\n\nThe compiler returns an error. This error means that the mutability\nlevel of the right operand is 1, here mut [c32], (the reference\nof the array is mutable but not its content), and the code try to put\nthe reference inside a variable of mutability level 2, that is to\nsay of type mut [mut c32]. If this was allowed the variable x\nwould have the possibility to change data that has been marked as\nimmutable at some point of the program, so the compiler does not allow\nit, and returns the following error.\nError : discard the constant qualifier is prohibited, left operand mutability level is 2 but must be at most 1\n --> main.yr:(4,11)\n 4  ┃     let dmut x = \"Try to make me mutable !?\";\n    ╋              ^\n    ┃ Note : \n    ┃  --> main.yr:(4,15)\n    ┃  4  ┃     let dmut x = \"Try to make me mutable !?\";\n    ┃     ╋                  ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n1.3. Memory borrowing\nWhen you want to make a copy of a value whose type is aliasable, you\nmust tell the compiler how you want to make the copy. There are four\nways to move or reference memory, which are provided with the four\nkeywords ref, alias, copy and dcopy. The following chapters\npresents these keywords, and the semantic associated to them.\n"},"advanced/references.html":{"url":"advanced/references.html","title":"References","keywords":"","body":"1. Reference1.1. Reference as function parameter1.2. Reference as a value1.3. Reference as function return1. Reference\nThe keywordref is a keyword that is placed before the\ndeclaration of a variable. It is used to refer to a value, which is\nusually borrowed from another variable. They are performing similar\noperation as\nPointers,\nwith the difference that they does not need to be dereferenced (this\nis done automatically), and pointer arithmetics is not possible with\nreferences. In Ymir references are always set, and are always set\nfrom another variable, hence they are way safer than pointers, and\nmust be prefered to them when possible.\ndef foo () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let ref y = ref x;\n    //          ^^^    \n    // Try to remove the keyword ref.\n}\n\n\nThe above program can be represented in memory as shown in the\nfollowing figure.\n\n\n\nIn this figure, one can note that y, is a pointer to x, which\ncan be used as if it was directly x. This means that y\nmust have the same mutability properties (or lower) as x. And\nthat if x is mutable, changing the value of y would also\nchange x.\nA first example of reference is presented in the following source\ncode. In this example, a mutable variable x contains a value of\ntype i32. This value is placed on the stack, as it is not a\naliasable type. Then a variable y is constructed as a reference\nof the variable x. Modifying y in the following example, also\nmodifies x.\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let mut x = 12; // place a value of type i32 and value 12 on the stack\n    let ref mut y = ref x; // create a reference of x\n    y = 42; // modify the value pointed by the reference\n    assert (x == 42);\n}\n\n\nA more complexe example is presented in the following source code. In\nthis example, a deeply mutable array x is created. This array is\na reference on borrowed data in the heap. A deeply mutable reference\ny is the, made on that variable x, which is allowed\nbecause x is also deeply mutable and the mutability level of\nx and y are the same. When changing the value of y\n(here the reference of the slice), it does not only change the\nreference of y but also the reference of x.\ndef main () {\n    let mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2, 3];\n    let ref mut y : [mut i32] = ref x;\n    y = [7, 8, 9]; // modify the value pointed by the reference (in the stack)\n    y [0] = 89; // modify the value on the heap\n    assert (x == [89, 8, 9]); \n}\n\n1.1. Reference as function parameter\nA parameter of a function can be a reference. As with the local\nvariable, when a value is passed to it, you must tell the compiler\nthat you understand that you are passing the value by reference, and\naccept the side effects it may have on your values.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (ref mut x : i32) {\n    x = 123;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = 12;\n    //  ^^^\n    // Try to remove the mut\n    foo (ref x);\n    //   ^^^\n    // Try to remove the ref\n    println (x); \n}\n\n\nThe following figure shows the memory status of the previous code:\n\nThe keyword ref is not always associated with a mutable variable, it\ncan be used to pass a complex type to a function more efficiently,\nwhen you don't want to make a complete copy, which would be much less\nefficient. In this case, you should always specify that you pass the\nvariable by reference, to distinguish it from the function that passes\nthe variable directly by value. In practice, due to the existence of\naliasable types, which will be discussed in the next chapter, you will\nnever gain anything by doing this.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo ( x : i32) {\n//       ^\n// Try to add mut here\n    println (\"By value : \", x);\n}\n\ndef foo (ref x : i32) {\n    println (\"By reference : \", x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 89;\n    foo (x);\n    foo (ref x);\n}\n\nResults:\nBy value : 89\nBy reference : 89\n\nIf you have done the exercise, and added the keyword mut to the\nsignature of the first function foo, you should get the following\nerror: \nError : a parameter cannot be mutable, if it is not a reference\n --> main.yr:(4,14)\n    | \n 4  | def foo (mut x : i32) {\n    |              ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\nThis error means that the type of x is not aliasable, so if it is not\na reference, marking it as mutable will have no effect on the program,\nso the compiler does not allow it.\n1.2. Reference as a value\nA reference is not a type, it is only a kind of variable, you cannot\nstore references in subtypes (for example, you cannot make an array of\nreferences, or a tuple containing a reference to a value). This means\nthat with the following code, you should will get an error.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 12;\n    let y = (10, ref x);\n}\n\n The following error means that the source code intended to create\na reference on a variable, but the compiler will not make it, as it\nhas no interest and will be immediately dereferenced to be stored in\nthe tuple value.\nWarning : the creation of ref has no effect on left operand\n --> main.yr:(3,19)\n    | \n 3  |     let y = (10, ref x);\n    |                      ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.3. Reference as function return\nYou may be skeptical about the interest of returning a reference to a\nvariable, and we agree with you. That is why, it is impossible to\nreturn a reference to a variable as a function return value. \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> ref i32 {\n    let x = 12;\n    ref x\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let ref y = ref foo (); // x would no longer exists\n    println (y); // and a seg fault would be raised, when using the reference\n}\n\n\nWith the above source code, the compiler return this fairly straightforward error.\nError : cannot return a reference type\n --> main.yr:(3,19)\n    | \n 3  | def foo () -> ref i32 {\n    |                   ^^^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n"},"advanced/alias.html":{"url":"advanced/alias.html","title":"Aliases","keywords":"","body":"1. Alias1.1. Alias a function parameter1.1.1. Alias in uniform call syntax1.2. Special case of struct and tuple1. Alias\nAll types that containing a pointer to data in the heap (or the stack)\nare aliasable types. An aliasable type cannot be implicitly copied,\nnor can it be implicitly referenced, for performance and security\nreasons respectively. There are mainly three aliasable types, arrays\n(or slices, there is no difference in Ymir), pointers, and\nobjects. Structures and tuples containing aliasable types are also\naliasable.\nThe keyword alias is used to inform the compiler that the used\nunderstand that the data borrowed by a variable (or a value) will\nborrowed by another values.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2, 3];\n    let mut y : [mut i32] = alias x; // allow y to borrow the value of x\n    //                      ^^^^^\n    // Try to remove the alias\n    println (y);\n}\n\n\nThis source code can be represented in memory by the following figure.\n\nThe alias keyword is only mandatory when the variable that will borrow\nthe data is mutable and may impact the value. It is obvious that one\ncannot borrow immutable data from a variable that is mutable.

There is no problem,\nthe values of x will not be changed, no matter what is done with\ny.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let mut y = x; \n    // y [0] = 9;\n    // Try to add the above line \n\n    y = [7, 8, 9];\n    println (y);\n}\n\n\nYou may have noticed that even though the literal is actually the\nelement that creates the data, we do not consider it to be the owner\nof the data, so the keyword alias is implied when it is literal. We\nconsider the data to have an owner only once it has been assigned to a\nvariable.\nThere are other kinds of alias that are implicitly allowed, such\nas code blocks or function calls. Those are implicit because\nthe alias is already made within the value of these elements.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> dmut [i32] {\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    alias x // alias is done here and mandatory\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let x = foo (); // no need to alias, it must have been done in the function\n    assert (x == [1, 2, 3]);\n}\n\n\n1.1. Alias a function parameter\nAs you have noticed, the keyword alias, unlike the keyword ref,\ndoes not characterize a variable. The type of a variable will indicate\nwhether the type should be passed by alias or not, so there is no\nchange in the definition of the function. When the type of a parameter\nis an aliasable type, this parameter can be mutable without being a\nreference.\nimport std::io\n\n// The function foo will be allowed to modify the internal values of y\ndef foo (mut y : [mut i32])\n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    y [0] = y [1];\n    y = [8, 3, 4]; // has no impact on the x of main,\n    // y is a reference to the data borrowed not to the variable x itself\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &OutOfArray, &AssertError\n{\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    foo (alias x);\n    //   ^^^^^\n    // Try to remove the alias\n    assert (x == [2, 2, 3]);\n}\n\n\nAs with the variable, if the function parameter cannot affect the\nvalues that are borrowed, the alias keyword is not required.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (x : [i32]) {\n    println (x); // just reads the borrowed data, but doesn't modify them\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let dmut x = [1, 2, 3];    \n    foo (x); // no need to alias\n}\n\n\n1.1.1. Alias in uniform call syntax\nWe have seen in the function chapter, the uniform call syntax. This\nsyntax is used to call a function using the dot operator ., by\nputting the first parameter of the function on the left of the\noperation. When the first parameter is of an aliasable type, the first\nargument must be aliased explicitely, leading to a strange and verbose\nsyntax.\nlet dmut a = [1, 2, 3];\n(alias a).foo (12); // same a foo (alias a, 12);\n\n\nTo avoid verbosity, we added the operator :., to use the\nuniform call syntax with an aliasable first parameter. \nlet dmut a = [1, 2, 3];\na:.foo (12); // same as foo (alias a, 12);\n\n\nThis operator is very usefull when dealing with classes, where the\nuniform call syntax is mandatory, as we will see in chapter\nClass.\n1.2. Special case of struct and tuple\nIn the chapter\nStructure\nyou will learn how to create a structure containing several fields of\ndifferent types. You have already learned how to make tuples. These\ntypes are sometimes aliasable, depending on the internal type they\ncontain. If a tuple, or a structure, has a field whose type is aliasable,\nthen the tuple or structure is also aliasable.\nThe table below presents some examples of aliasable tuples : \n\n\n\nType\nAliasable\nReason\n\n\n\n\n(i32, i32)\nfalse\ni32 is not aliasable\n\n\n([i32],)\ntrue\n[i32] is a slice, and hence aliasable\n\n\n([i32], f64)\ntrue\n[i32] is a slice, and hence aliasable\n\n\n(([i32], i32), f64)\ntrue\n[i32] is a slice, and hence aliasable\n\n\n\nIn the introduction of this chapter we presented the notion of\nMutability\nlevel. One\ncan note that mutability level is not suitable for tuple, as aliasable\ntuple are trees of type and not simply a list. However, this does not\nchange much, the compiler just check the mutability level of the inner\ntypes of the tuple, recursively.\n"},"advanced/copies.html":{"url":"advanced/copies.html","title":"Copy and Deep copy","keywords":"","body":"1. Copy data to make them mutable1.1. Copy1.2. Deep copy1. Copy data to make them mutable\nSometimes it is not possible to allow data to be borrowed by foreign\nfunctions or variables. This can be due to the facts that data are\nimmutable for example. To solve this problem, Ymir provides two\nkeywords, copy and dcopy.\n1.1. Copy\nThe copy keyword makes a copy of the first level of a value,\nwhose type is aliasable. This copy transform an immutable type into a\nmutable one, by increasing its mutability level by one. The following\ntable shows some examples of the types of copied values :\n\n\n\nType\nType of copied value\n\n\n\n\n[i32]\nmut [mut i32]\n\n\nmut [i32]\nmut [mut i32]\n\n\nmut [[i32]]\nmut [mut [i32]]\n\n\n\nAn example of what can be achieved by copy keyword is shown in\nthe following code. The representation of the memory is also shown in\nthe figure underneath. In this example, the variable x is copied\nand the result value is placed in the variable y. In this\nexample, each variable are borrowing different data placed on the\nheap, whose values are equivalent.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError, &OutOfArray\n{\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let dmut y = copy x; // create a copy of x\n    assert (x == y); // y and x have the same value, but at different location\n\n    y [0] = 9; \n    assert (x == [1, 2, 3]); // modifying y does not affect x\n    assert (y == [9, 2, 3]); // but still affects y\n}\n\n\nWe can see from the figure below, that the variable y points to\ndata at a different location, from the data pointed by x. This\nimplies a new memory allocation, and a memory copy, that cost some cpu\ntime, and memory place. For that reason, copies are never hidden by\nthe language, and are made only when the keyword copy is placed\nin the source code.\n\nExercise : Modify x that is initialised with an imutable string literal : \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray \n{\n    let x = \"hello !\";\n    x [0] = 'H'; // Make this line work\n    assert (x == \"Hello !\");\n}\n\n Correction (spoiler) : \n\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () \n    throws &OutOfArray, &AssertError\n{\n\tlet dmut x = copy \"hello !\";\n\tx [0] = 'H'; // Well done\n\tassert (x == \"Hello !\");\n}\n\n\n1.2. Deep copy\nThe deep copy will make a copy of the value and all internal values,\nit must be used in special cases because it is much less efficient\nthan the simple copy, which copies only one level of the data. There\nis nothing complex to understand in deep copy, it simply creates a\nvalue, deeply mutable, which is an exact copy.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = [[1], [2, 3], [4]];\n    let dmut y = dcopy x;\n    let mut z : [mut [i32]] = copy x;\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z);\n}\n\n"},"advanced/best.html":{"url":"advanced/best.html","title":"Best practice","keywords":"","body":"1. Best practice1. Best practice\nThe copy is never hidden in the source code that is available to the\nuser. However, many codes that we are using on a daily basis, are\nprovided by libraries. In libraries, only the prototypes of the\nfunctions are presented to the user, and therefore if a copy is made\ninside a function, the copy is hidden from the user. We cannot\nguarantee that such copy are not made (at least for the moment), so we\npropose a best practice advice to avoid hidden copies inside\nlibraries.\nThis advice is simple, never take a immutable parameter in a function,\nif you have to make a copy of it inside the function. For example, let\nsay we have a function that sorts a slice. This function should\npreferably take a mutable slice as input and modify it directly.\ndef good (dmut slc : [i32])-> dmut [i32] {\n    // perform the sort on slc\n    alias slc\n}\n\ndef bad (slc : [i32])-> dmut [i32] {\n    let dmut res = copy slc;\n    // perform the sort on res\n    alias res}\n\n\nThis way, the function calling the sort function has the choice of\nmaking the copy or not. In the following example, the user has the\nchoice when calling the function good, but never when calling\nthe function bad, making the copy hidden. One can note from the\nfollowing example, that the copy is never hidden when calling\ngood, and that it is also possible to make no copy at all.\ndef main () {\n    let dmut slc = [9, 3, 7];\n    let dmut aux = good (copy slc); // slc is unchanged, and aux is sorted\n    let dmut slc2 = good (alias slc); // slc is sorted, and slc2 points the data of slc\n\n    good (slc); // impossible, implicit alias is not allowed\n\n    bad (slc); // here there is not need for alias, nor copy, \n               // the data of slc won't be modified in bad\n               // the copy is alway made and hidden\n}\n\n\nFrom the above example, the compiler returns an error, when trying to\ncall the function good without aliasing nor copying at line\n6. This error prevents from copying values implicitely without\nwritting it down, nor making aliasing of the values and giving the\nwrite permission to foreign functions without informing the compiler\nof our agreement.

Symbol conflict resolution1.5. Public importation1.5.1. Best practice1.6. Include directory1.7. Compilation of modules1. Modules\nWhen creating a large project, it is very important to organize your\ncode. Ymir offers a system of modules, which is used to manage\ndifferent parts of the code that have different purposes. Each source\nfile in Ymir is a module.\n1.1. File hierarchy\nLets have a look at the following file hierarchy : \n.\n├── main.yr\n└── extern_modules\n    ├── bar.yr\n    └── foo.yr\n\n1 directory, 3 files\n\nIn this file hierarchy there are three files, which contain modules, the\nfirst module in the file main.yr will be named main. The second\none in the extern_modules/bar.yr file will be named extern_modules::bar,\nand the third one in the extern_modules/foo.yr file will be named\nextern_modules::foo.\nTo be properly importable, the module must be defined from the\nrelative path of the compilation, i.e. if the file is located in\n$(pwd)/relative/path/to/file, its module name must be\nrelative::path::to::file.\nThe name of a module is defined by the first line of the source code,\nby keyword mod. If this line is not given by the user, the path of\nthe module will only be the file name, so you will not always be able\nto import the module, depending on its relative path. You can consider\nthis line mandatory for the moment. \nFor example, in the file foo.yr, the first line must look like : \nmod extern_modules::foo\n\n\nAnd, it will therefore be importable everywhere, for example in the\nmain module, when writing the import declaration :\nimport extern_modules::foo\n\n \nThe syntax of the import statement is the following :\nimport_statement := 'import' path (',' path)* (';')?\npath := Identifier ('::' Identifier)* ('::' '_')?\n\n1.2. Sub modules\nSub modules are local modules, declared inside a global modules, are\ninside another sub module. Unlike global module, the access to the\nsymbols defined inside them is not implicit. For that reason they have\nto be explicitely mentionned when trying to access to their\nsymbols. This mention is done with the double colon binary operator\n::, where the first operand is the name of the module, and the\nsecond the name of the symbol to access.\nmod main\nimport std::io;\n\nmod InnerModule {\n\n    pub def foo () {\n        println (\"Foo\");\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    InnerModule::foo (); // access of the function declared in InnerModule\n}\n\nThe access operator ::, can also be used to access to symbols\ndeclared inside global modules. This will be discussed after talking\nabout privacy of symbols.\n1.3. Privacy\nAll symbols defined in a module are private by default. The privacy of\na given symbol s refer to the possibility for foreign modules, and\nsymbols to access to this given symbol s. When a symbol s is\ndeclared private in a module s, then only the other symbols of the\nmodule m have access to it. Module privacy can be seen as a tree,\nwhere a global module is a root, and module symbols are the branches\nand leaves of the tree. In such a tree, symbols have access to their\nparent, siblings, and the siblings of their parents. \nIn the following figure an example of a module tree is presented,\nwhere a global module named A, has three symbols, 2 sub modules\nA::X and A::Y, and a function A::foo. In this tree, we assume\nthat every symbols are declared private. For that reason, the function\nA::foo has access to A, A::X, A::Y, but not to A::X::bar,\nnor A::Y::baz. The symbol A::X::bar, has access to every symbols\n(A, A::X, A::Y, A::foo), except A::Y::baz.\n\n\n\nGlobal modules are always tree roots, for that reason they don't have\nparents. For example, the module extern_modules::foo, does not\nhave access to the symbols declared inside the module\nextern_modules, (if they are privates).\nThe keyword pub flag a symbol as public, and accessible by\nforeign modules. This keyword can be used as a block, or for only one\nsymbol. Its syntax grammar is presented in the following code block.\npub :=   'pub' '{' symbol* '}' \n       | 'pub' symbol\n\n1.3.1. Example\n1) Module extern_modules/foo.yr\nmod extern_modules::foo;\n\n/**\n * foo is public, it can be accessed from foreign modules\n */\npub def foo () {}\n\n/**\n * The bar function is private by default\n * Thus only usable in this module\n */\ndef bar () {}\n\n\n2) Module main.yr\n/**\n * This importation will give access to all the symbols in the module\n * 'extern_modules::foo' that have been declared 'public'\n */\nimport extern_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (); // foo is public we can call it\n    bar (); // however, bar is private thus not accessible\n}\n\nErrors:\nError : undefined symbol bar\n --> main.yr:(7,5)\n 7  ┃     bar (); // however, bar is private thus not accessible\n    ╋     ^^^\n    ┃ Note : bar --> extern_modules/foo.yr:(8,5) : extern_modules::foo::bar is private within this context\n    ┗━━━━━━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n1.4. Symbol conflict resolution\nWhen two external global modules declare two symbols with the same\nname, it may be impossible to know which symbol the user is refereing\nto. In this case, the double colon operator :: can be used with\nthe name of the module declaring the symbol to resolve the\nambiguity. To give an example of symbol conflict, let's say that we\nhave two module extern_modules::foo and extern_modules::bar\ndeclaring a function with the same signature foo.\n1) Module extern_modules/bar.yr\nmod extern_modules::bar\nimport std::io\n\npub def foo () {\n    println (\"Bar\");\n}\n\n\n2) Module extern_modules/foo.yr\nmod extern_modules::foo\nimport std::io\n\npub def foo () {\n    println (\"Foo\");\n}\n\n\nIn the main module, both modules extern_modules::bar and\nextern_modules::foo, are imported. The main function presented below\nrefers to the symbol foo. In that case, there is no way to tell\nwhich function will be used, extern_modules::foo::foo or\nextern_modules::bar::foo. The compiler returns an error. One can\nnote that this errors occurs only because the signature of the two\nfunction foo are the same (taking no parameters), and they are both\npublic. If there was a difference in their prototypes, for example if\nthe function in the module extern_modules::bar would take a value of\ntype i32 as parameter, the conflict would be resolved by itself, as\nthe call expression will be different.\n3) Module main.yr\nimport extern_modules::bar, extern_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\nErrors:\nError : {extern_modules::bar::foo ()-> void, extern_modules::foo::foo ()-> void, mod extern_modules::foo} x 3 called with {} work with both\n --> main.yr:(4,6)\n 4  ┃     foo ();\n    ╋         ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate foo --> extern_modules/bar.yr:(4,9) : extern_modules::bar::foo ()-> void\n    ┃ Note : candidate foo --> extern_modules/foo.yr:(4,9) : extern_modules::foo::foo ()-> void\n    ┗━━━━━━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n.page-inner {\n  width: 95%;\n}\nIn the above error, we can see that three modules are presented. The\ntwo functions foo — in extern_modules::bar, and\nextern_modules::foo — and the extern_modules::foo module\nitself. Obviously, it is not possible to use the call operator\n() on a module, that is why it is not presented as a possible\ncanditate in the notes of the error.\nThe conflict problem can be resolved by changing the calling\nexpression, and using the double colon operator ::. In the\nfollowing example, the full name of the module is used. This is not\nalways necessary, as bar::foo is sufficient to refer to\nextern_modules::bar::foo, and foo::foo for function\nfoo in extern_modules::foo.\nimport extern_modules::bar, extern_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    extern_modules::bar::foo (); \n    extern_modules::foo::foo (); \n\n    foo::foo (); \n    bar::foo ();\n}\n\nResults:\nBar\nFoo\nFoo\nBar\n\n1.5. Public importation\nAs for all declaration, importation are private. It means that the\nimportation is not recursive. For example, if the module\nextern_modules::foo imports the module extern_modules::bar, and the\nmodule main import the module extern_modules::foo, all the public\nsymbols declared in extern_modules::bar will not be accessible in the\nmodule main.\nYou can of course, make a pub importation, to make the symbols of\nthe module extern_modules::bar visible for the module main.\n1) Module extern_modules/bar.yr\nmod extern_modules::bar\nimport std::io\n\npub def bar () {\n    println (\"Bar\");\n}\n\n\n2) Module extern_modules/foo.yr\nmod extern_modules::foo\n\npub import extern_modules::bar\n\n\n3) Module main.yr\nmod main\nimport extern_modules::foo;\n\ndef main () {\n    bar ();\n}\n\n\nIn the example above, the function bar defined in the module\nextern_modules::bar, is imported (because the function is public\nis public) by the module extern_modules::foo. This importation\nis public, thus when the module main imports the module\nextern_modules::foo, it also imports the module\nextern_modules::bar, and has access to the function bar. \n1.5.1. Best practice\nPublic importation must be used with caution, to avoid polluting other\nmodules. A good practice, is to define some modules only to make\npublic importations. These modules should be named _. For\nexample, with our previous file hierarchy, a file\nextern_modules/_.yr would be added, and no public imports made\nin the modules extern_modules::foo, nor in the module\nextern_modules::bar.\nmod extern_modules::_;\n\npub import extern_modules::foo;\npub import extern_modules::bar;\n\n\nThese modules are not automatically generated by Ymir — even if it\nseems trivial —, to allow importing only a subset of the modules\ncontained in a sub directory. These importation modules are optional\nand left to the choice of the user.\n1.6. Include directory\nYou can use the -I option, to add a path to the include\ndirectory. This path will be used as if it was the current $(pwd). In\nother words, if you add the I -path/to/modules option, and you have a\nfile in path/to/modules/relative/to/my/file, the name of the module\nmust be relative::to::my::file.\ngyc -I ~/libs/ main.yr\n\nThis is how the standard library is included in the build, and how you\ncan access modules in std:: that are not located in $(pwd)/std/.\n1.7. Compilation of modules\nAll modules must be compiled, the import declaration is just a\ndirective of for symbols access, but does not compile the imported\nsymbols. For example, in the following example, there are two modules,\none declaring a function foo, and the other importing it and\ncalling it. \n1) Module main.yr\nmod main\nimport extern_modules::foo;\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\n\n2) Module extern_modules/foo.yr\nmod extern_modules::foo\n\npub def foo () {}\n\n\nBy compiling only the main function, the compiler returns a link\nerror. This error means that the symbol foo declared in the module\nextern_modules::foo was not found during the symbol linkage. \n$ gyc main.yr\n/tmp/ccCOeXDq.o: In function `_Y4mainFZv':\nmain.yr:(.text+0x3e): undefined reference to `_Y14extern_modules3foo3fooFZv'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nTo avoid this error, and create a valid executable, where all symbols\ncan be found, the module extern_modules::foo has to be compiled\nas well. GYC is able to manage object files (containing pre compiled\nsymbols), and compiled libraries. The way GYC manage these kind of\nobjects is similar to all compiler of the GCC suite, and is not\npresented in this documentation (cf. GCC options for linking).\n$ gyc main.yr extern_modules/foo.yr\n"},"types/":{"url":"types/","title":"User defined types","keywords":"","body":"1. User defined types1.

Structure\nStructure is a common design used in many languages to define users'\ncustom types. They contains multiple values of different types,\naccessible by identifiers. Structures are similar to tuples, in terms\nof memory management (located in the stack). Unlike tuples, structures\nare named, and all their internal fields are named as well. \nThe complete grammar of structure definition is presented in the\nfollowing code block. One can note the possibility to add templates to\nthe definition of the structure. These templates will only be\ndiscussed in the chapter\nTemplates,\nand are not of interest to us at the moment.\nstruct_type := 'struct' ('|' var_decl)* '->' identifier (templates)?\nvar_decl := ('mut'?) identifier ':' type ('=' expression)?\nidentifier := ('_')* [A-z] ([A-z0-9_])*\n\n\nThe fields of the structure are defined using the same syntax as the\ndeclaration of function parameters, i.e. the same syntax as variable\ndeclaration but with the keyword let omitted. The following\nsource code presents a definition of a structure Point with two\nfields x and y of type i32. The two fields of this\nstructure are immutable, and have no default values.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n| y : i32 \n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let point = Point (1, 2); // initialize the value of the structure\n    println (point); // structures are printable\n}\n\n\nResults:\nmain::Point(1, 2)\n\nIt is possible to declare a structure with no fields.

Structure construction\nThe construction of a structure is made using the same syntax as a\nfunction call, that is to say using its identifier and a list of\nparameters inside parentheses and separated by comas. Like function\ncalls, structure can have default values assigneted to fields. The\nvalue of these fields can be changed using the named expression\nsyntax, which is constructed with the arrow operator ->. Field\nwithout default value can also be constructed using the named\nexpression syntax. In that case, the order of field construction is\nnot important.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32 = 0\n| y : i32 \n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let point = Point (y-> 12, x-> 98);\n    println (point);\n\n    let point2 = Point (1);\n    println (point2);\n}\n\nResults:\nmain::Point(98, 12)\nmain::Point(0, 1)\n\n1.2. Field access\nThe fields of a structure are always public, and accessible using the\ndot binary operator ., where the left operand is a value whose\ntype is a structure, and the right operand is the identifier of the\nfield.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n| y : i32 \n -> Point;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let point = Point (1, 2); \n    assert (point.x == 1 && point.y == 2);\n}\n\n1.3. Structure mutability\nThe mutability of a field of a structure is defined in the structure\ndeclaration. As with any variable declaration, the fields of a\nstructure are by default immutable. By adding the keyword mut\nbefore the identifier of a field, the field becomes mutable. However,\nthe mutability is transitive in Ymir, meaning that a immutable value\nof a struct type, cannot be modified even if its field are marked\nmutable. Consequently, for a field to be really mutable, it must be\nmarked as such, and be a field of a mutable value.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n| mut y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut p1 = Point (1, 2);\n    p1.y = 98; // y is mutable\n                  // and p1 is mutable no problem\n\n    p1.x = 34; // x is not mutable, this won't compile\n\n    let p2 = Point (1, 2);\n    p2.y = 98; // p2 is not mutable, this won't compile    \n}\n\nErrors:\nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(13,4)\n13  ┃     p1.x = 34; // x is not mutable, this won't compile\n    ╋       ^\n\nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(16,4)\n16  ┃     p2.y = 98; // p2 is not mutable, this won't compile    \n    ╋       ^\n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.4. Memory borrowing of structure\nBy default structure data are located in the value that contains them,\ni.e. in the stack inside a variable, on the heap inside a slice,\netc. They are copied by value, at assignement or function call. This\ncopy is static, and does not require allocation, so it is allowed\nimplicitely. \nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| mut x : i32\n| mut y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let p = Point (1, 2);\n    let mut p2 = p; // make a copy of the structure\n    p2.y = 12;\n\n    assert (p.y == 2);\n    assert (p2.y == 12);\n}\n\n\nStructure may contain aliasable values, such as slice. In that case,\nthe copy is no longer allowed implicitely (if the structure is\nmutable, and the field containing the aliasable value is also\nmutable, and the element that will borrow the data is also\nmutable). To resolve the problem, the keywords dcopy, and alias\npresented in Aliases and\nReferences\ncan be used.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| mut y : [mut [mut i32]]\n -> Point;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &OutOfArray\n{\n    let mut a = Point ([[1, 23, 3], [4, 5, 6]]);\n    let mut b = dcopy a;\n    let mut c = alias a;\n\n    b.y [0][0] = 9; // only change the value of 'b'\n    c.y [0][1] = 2; // change the value of 'a' and 'c'\n\n    println (a);\n    println (b);\n    println (c);\n}\n\n\nResults:\nmain::Point([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nmain::Point([[9, 23, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nmain::Point([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n\nIt is impossible to make a simple copy of a structure with the keyword\ncopy, the mutability level being set once and for all in the\nstructure definition. For example, if a structure S contains a field\nwhose type is mut [mut [i32]], every value of type S have a\nfield of type mut [mut [i32]]. For that reason, by making a\nfirst level copy, the mutability level would not be respected.\n1.5. Packed and Union\nThis part only concerns advanced programming paradigms, and is close\nto the machine level. It is unlikely that you will ever need it,\nunless you try to optimize your code at a binary level.\n1.5.1. Packed\nThe size of a structure is calculated by the compiler, which decides\nthe alignment of the different fields. This is why the size of a\nstructure containing an i64 and a c8 is 16 bytes, not 9\nbytes. There is no guarantee about the size or the order of the fields\nin the generated program. To force the compiler to remove the\noptimized alignment, the special modifier packed can be\nused. \nimport std::io\n\nstruct @packed\n| x : i64\n| c : c8\n -> Packed;\n\nstruct \n| x : i64\n| c : c8\n -> Unpacked;\n\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Size of packed : \", sizeof Packed);\n    println (\"Size of unpacked : \", sizeof Unpacked);\n}\n\nResults: \nSize of packed : 9\nSize of unpacked : 16\n1.5.2. Union\nThe union special modifier , on the other hand, informs the\ncompiler that all fields in the structure must share the same memory\nlocation. In the following example, the union modifier is used\non a structure containing two fields. The largest field of the\nstructure is the field y of type f64. The size of this\nfield is 8 bytes, thus the structure has a size of 8 bytes as\nwell. All the fields are aligned at the beginning of the strucures,\nmeaning that the field x, and y shares the same address in\nmemory.\nstruct @union \n| x : i32\n| y : f64\n -> Dummy;\n\n\nThe construction of a structure with union modifier requires\nonly one argument. This argument must be passed as a named\nexpression with the arrow operator ->.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct @union\n| x : i32\n| y : f32\n -> Dummy;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let x = Dummy (y-> 12.0f);\n\n    // Comparison of pointer is only possible on pointer of the same type\n    // Any pointer can be casted into a pointer of &void (the contrary is not possible)\n    // is operator, checks if two pointer are equals\n    assert (cast!(&void) (&(x.x)) is cast!(&void) (&(x.y)));\n\n    // The value of x depends on the value of y\n    assert (x.x == 1094713344);\n    assert (x.y == 12.0f);\n}\n\n1.6. Structure specific attributes\nStructures have type specific attributes, as any types, accessible with\nthe double colon binary operator ::. The table below presents\nthese specific attributes. These attributes are accessible using a\ntype of struct, and not a value. A example, under the table presents\nusage of struct specific attributes.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value of the type\n\n\ntypeid\nThe name of the type stored in a value of type [c32]\n\n\ntypeinfo\nA structure of type TypeInfo, containing information about the type\n\n\n\nAll the information about TypeInfo are presented in chapter Dynamic types.\nmod main;\n\nimport std::io;\n\nstruct\n| x : i32\n| y : i32 = 9\n -> Point; \n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let x = Point::init;\n\n    // the structure is declared in the main module, thus its name is main::Point    \n    assert (Point::typeid == \"main::Point\");\n\n    assert (x.x == i32::init && x.y == 9);\n}\n\n"},"types/enum.html":{"url":"types/enum.html","title":"Enum","keywords":"","body":"1.

This implicit cast is allowed.\nimport std::io\n\nenum : [c32] // the type is optional\n| MONDAY = \"Mon\"\n| TUESDAY = \"Tue\"\n| WEDNESDAY = \"Wed\"\n| THURSDAY = \"Thu\"\n| FRIDAY = \"Fri\"\n| SATURDAY = \"Sat\"\n| SUNDAY = \"Sun\"\n -> Day;\n\ndef foo (day : [c32]) {\n    println (day);\n}\n\ndef bar (day : Day) {\n    println (day);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    // the internal type Day is of type [c32], so it can be implicitely casted into [c32]\n    foo (Day::MONDAY);\n\n    bar (Day::MONDAY);\n\n    // However, it is impossible to transform a [c32] into a Day implicitely\n    bar (\"Mon\")\n}\n\n\nHowever, the contrary is not allowed, because the source code tries to\ncast a [c32] into a Day at line 28, the compiler\nreturns an error. The error is presented in the code block below. Such\ncast is forbidden, to avoid enumeration value to contain a value that\nis actually not defined in the list of the field of the\nenumeration. For example, if this was accepted, the string\n\"NotADay\" would be castable into a Day (note: the value\nof the string being possibly unknown at compilation time).\nError : the call operator is not defined for main::bar and {mut [c32]}\n --> main.yr:(28,9)\n28  ┃     bar (\"Mon\")\n    ╋         ^     ^\n    ┃ Note : candidate bar --> main.yr:(17,5) : main::bar (day : main::Day([c32]))-> void\n    ┃     ┃ Error : incompatible types main::Day and mut [c32]\n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(28,10)\n    ┃     ┃ 28  ┃     bar (\"Mon\")\n    ┃     ┃     ╋          ^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : for parameter day --> main.yr:(17,10) of main::bar (day : main::Day([c32]))-> void\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n\n1.1.2. Value constructions\nEnumeration values can be more complex than literals. Any kind of\nvalue can be used, for example call functions, condition block, scope\nguards, etc. In the following example, an enumeration creating\nstructure from function call is presented. The type of the enumeration\nis Ipv4Addr.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct\n| a : i32\n| b : i32\n| c : i32\n| d : i32\n -> Ipv4Addr;\n\nenum\n| LOCALHOST = localhost ()\n| BROADCAST = broadcast ()\n -> KnownAddr;\n\ndef localhost ()-> Ipv4Addr {\n    println (\"Call localhost\");\n    Ipv4Addr (127, 0, 0, 1)\n}\n\ndef broadcast ()-> Ipv4Addr {\n    println (\"Call broadcast\");    \n    Ipv4Addr (255, 255, 255, 255)\n}\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    let addr = KnownAddr::LOCALHOST; // will call localhost here\n\n    assert (KnownAddr::LOCALHOST.a == 127); // a second time here\n    assert (KnownAddr::BROADCAST.d == 255); // call broadcast here\n    assert (addr.a == 127);\n}\n\n\nThe enumeration value of a field is constructed at each access, this\nmeans for example that when enumeration values are constructed using\nfunction call, the function is called each time the enumeration field\nis accessed. Thus the result of the execution of the compiled source\ncode above is the following:\nCall localhost\nCall localhost\nCall broadcast\n\n1.1.3. Value context\nIf the value of the enumeration seems to be passed at the caller\nlocation, they don't share the context of the caller. In other words,\nthe fields of an enumeration have access to the symbol accessible from\nthe enumeration context, and not from the caller context. An example,\nof enumeration trying to access symbols is presented in the source\ncode bellow.\nimport std::io\n\nstatic __GLOB__ = true;\n\nenum \n| FOO = (if (x) { 42 } else { 11 })\n| BAR = (if (__GLOB__) { 42 } else { 11 })\n -> ErrorEnum;\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = false;\n\n    println (ErrorEnum::FOO); \n}\n\n \nFrom the above example, the compiler returns an error. In this error,\nthe compiler informs that the variable x is not defined from the\ncontext of the enumeration. Even if the variable is declared inside\nthe main function, it is not accessible from the enumeration\ncontext. The global variable __GLOB__ is accessible from the\nenumeration context, and thus accessing it is not an issue.\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(6,3)\n 6  ┃ | FOO = (if (x) { 42 } else { 11 })\n    ╋   ^^^\n    ┃ Error : undefined symbol x\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(6,14)\n    ┃  6  ┃ | FOO = (if (x) { 42 } else { 11 })\n    ┃     ╋              ^\n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(13,11)\n13  ┃     println (ErrorEnum::FOO); \n    ╋              ^^^^^^^^^\n    ┃ Error : the type main::ErrorEnum is not complete due to previous errors\n    ┃  --> main.yr:(8,5)\n    ┃  8  ┃  -> ErrorEnum;\n    ┃     ╋     ^^^^^^^^^\n    ┃     ┃ Note : \n    ┃     ┃  --> main.yr:(13,11)\n    ┃     ┃ 13  ┃     println (ErrorEnum::FOO); \n    ┃     ┃     ╋              ^^^^^^^^^\n    ┃     ┗━━━━━┻━ \n    ┗━━━━━┻━ \n\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n\n1.2. Enumeration specific attributes\nAs for any type, enumeration have specific type attributes. The table\nbelow lists the enumeration type specific attributes.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nmembers\nA slice containing all the values of the enumeration\n\n\nmember_names\nA slice of [c32], containing all the names of the fields of the enumeration (same order than members)\n\n\ntypeid\nThe type identifier of the enumeration type in a [c32] typed value\n\n\ntypeinfo\nThe typeinfo of the inner type of the enumeration (cf. Dynamic types)\n\n\ninner\nThe inner type of the enumeration\n\n\n\n\nOne may note that the operator to access specific attributes and field\nis the same (double colon binary operator ::), and therefore\nthat if an enumeration have a field named as a specific attributes\nthere is a conflict. To avoid conflict, the priority is given to the\nfields of the enumeration, and specific attributes can be accessed\nusing their identifier surrounded by _ tokens. For example,\naccessing the members specific attributes can be made using the\nidentifier __members__. An example of the principle is presented in\nthe following source code. The specific attribute surrounding is\napplicable to all types, but can be really usefull here.\nmod main;\n\nenum\n| typeid       = 1\n| typeinfo     = 2\n| members      = 3\n| member_names = 4\n| inner        = 5\n -> AnnoyingEnum;\n\ndef main ()\n    throws &AssertError\n{\n    assert (AnnoyingEnum::typeid == 1);\n    assert (AnnoyingEnum::__typeid == AnnoyingEnum::__typeid__);\n    assert (AnnoyingEnum::__typeid == \"main::AnnoyingEnum\");    \n}\n\n"},"types/aka.html":{"url":"types/aka.html","title":"Aka","keywords":"","body":"1. AKA1.1. Aka as a value1.2. Aka as a type1.3. Aka as symbols1. AKA\nAn aka create a symbol that is an alias for another\nexpression. Everything can be used to create an alias, not necessarily\na value, or a type.

Aka as a value\nAka can be used as a single value enumeration. As for enumeration\nvalues, akas are constructed at each access, and are for that reason\ncloser to enumeration, than to global variable. In addition, akas are\nonly defined during compilation time, and are not defined inside the\nexecutable, library, etc. generated by the compiler, contrary to\nglobal variables.\nAn example of an aka is presented in the source code below. In that\nexample, the aka refers to the call of the foo function, that is\ncalled each time the aka is used.\nimport std::io\n\naka CallFoo = foo ()\n\ndef foo () -> i32 {\n    println (\"Foo\");\n    42\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    println (CallFoo);\n    println (CallFoo);\n}\n\n\nResults:\nFoo\n42\nFoo\n42\n\nBecause akas are not global variable, they don't have an address,\nand are always immutable. They don't really have a type, and simply\nstick their content, at the location of the caller. However, like\nenumeration values, their context is the one of their declaration, not\nthe context of the caller. For that reason by compiling the following\nexample, the compiler returns an error.\nimport std::io\n\naka FOO = x // x is not defined in this context\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 12; // this x is local, and not accessible from FOO\n    println (FOO); // does not work\n}\n\n\nError: \nError : undefined type x\n --> main.yr:(3,11)\n 3  ┃ aka FOO = x\n    ╋           ^\n\n1.2.

Aka as symbols\nAkas are not confined to type, and values. They can create symbols\nto refer to other symbols. For example modules, functions, structures,\netc. \nimport std::io\n\naka IO = std::io\n\ndef println (a : i32) {\n    IO::println (\"My println : \", a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    IO::println (12);\n    println (12);\n}\n\n \nResults: \n12\nMy println : 12\n\nContribution : enable aka on import, with the syntax : import path\naka name.

Objects\nYmir is a object oriented language, with polymorph types. In this\nchapter, we assume that you are familiar with object oriented\nprogramming paradigm (if not, you will benefit from reading\ninformation on that paradigm first cf.  object oriented\nprogramming.).\nIn Ymir, object instances are dynamically allocated on the\nheap. Indeed, because object types are polymorph, their size cannot be\nknown at compile time, and consequently cannot be placed in the\nstack. To illustrate this point, the following figure presents the UML\ndefinition of a class A, and an heir class B. The class\nA contains a field x, of type i32, thus of size\n4 bytes. The class B, contains another field y of size\n4, leading to a class B of size 8.\n\nBecause we want to following source code to be accepted (basic\nprinciple of polymorphism), the size of A, cannot be statically\nset to 4 bytes, (nor to 8, the class B can come from a\ntotally different part of the source code - from a library for example\n-, and unknown when using the type A, without talking of the\nhuge loss of memory if only A values are used).\ndef foo (a : &(A)) // ...    \n\ndef main () {\n    let b : &B = // ...\n    foo (b); // calling foo with a B, heir of A\n}\n\nFor that reason, object instances are aliasable types, and only\ncontains a pointer to the values of the class. You may have notice the\nsyntax &(A), in the above example. If this syntax is similar to\npointer, this is because objects are basically pointers. However,\nunlike basic pointers, these cannot be used in pointer arithmetics,\ncannot be null, and does not need to be dereferenced to access\nthe value. In other words, these are reference, more than pointers.\nYes, unlike other object oriented language such as java or D,\nobject instances cannot be null. This is a really important part\nof the object system in Ymir guaranteeing that every objects are\npointing to a valid value, and that value is correctly initialized\n(constructor was called).\nWe will see in the coming chapters, that removing the possibility of\nnull objects does not remove any capacity on the language, while\nadding strong safety, the number one error of java programs\nbeing NullPointerException (cf. Which Java exceptions are the\nmost\nfrequent?,\nThe Top 10 Exception Types in Production Java Applications – Based on\n1B\nEvents).\n"},"objects/class.html":{"url":"objects/class.html","title":"Class","keywords":"","body":"1. Class1.1. Attributes1.2. Constructor1.3. Methods1.4. Destructors1. Class\nAn object is an instance of a class. A class is declared using the\nkeyword class. \nclass Foo {\n}\n\n1.1. Attributes\nA class can contain attributes, which are equivalent to fields for a\nstructure.  An attribute is declared as a variable, using the keyword\nlet. You must give at least the type to the declaration, but the\nvalue is not mandatory.\nclass Point {\n    let _x : i32;\n    let _y = 0;\n}\n\nAll attributes are protected by default, i.e. only this class and its\nheirs will have access to them. You can use the pub keyword to make\nthem public and usable everywhere.\n1.2. Constructor\nTo be instancible, a class must declare at least one constructor. The\nconstructor is always named self, and takes parameters to build the\nobject. The constructor must give a value to all the attributes of the\nclass, the attributes are initialized using the with keyword.\nclass Point {\n    let _x : i32;\n    let _y = 0;\n\n    // _y is already initialized\n    // it is not mandatory to add it in the with initialization\n    pub self () with _x = 12 {\n        // Try to print the attribute _x \n        // You will need to use self \n    }\n\n    pub self (x : i32, y : i32) with _x = x, _y = y {\n    }\n}\n\nOnce the class has constructors, you can call them using the following\nsyntax :\nlet p : Point = Point::new (); \nlet p2 : Point = Point::new (1, 2);\n// Try to add the following line : \n// let p3 : Point = null;\n\nConstructors, like methods are protected by default, you can use the\nkeyword pub to make them public and prv to make them private.\nA class is not a pointer, you can't make it null, that has no sense\nin Ymir.\nYou can call another constructor with the syntax with. When you call\nanother constructor, all fields are already initialized, so you cannot\ninitialize them again.\nclass Point {\n    // ... attributes\n\n    pub self () with self (0, 0) {}\n\n    pub self (x : i32, y : i32) with _x = x, _y = y {}\n}\n\n1.3. Methods\nMethods of a class are functions that are applicable to an object\ninstance. The methods are declared like function, but take the self\nas first parameter. The type of self is not specified because it is\nobvious.\nclass Point {\n    // ... the same declaration as above\n\n    pub def vector (self, other : Point) -> Point {\n        Point::new (other._x - self._x, other._y - self._y)\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let p1 = Point::new (1, 2), p2 = Point::new (2, 3);\n    let v = p1.vector (p2);\n}\n\nThe self instance is an alias of the object (Cf. Alias), which\nis imutable by default. You can make it mutable by using the mut\nkeyword. As for structures, the mutability of the attributes is\ndefined when they are declared. If an attribute is mutable, its\nmutability depends on the mutability of the instance of the object\nthat contains it.\nclass Point {\n    let mut _x : i32, mut _y = 0;\n\n    // ... the same constructors as above\n\n    pub def addOne (mut self) {\n    //          ^^^\n    // Try to remove the mut \n\n        self._x += 1;\n        self._y += 1;\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut p = Point::new (1, 2);\n    //  ^^^\n    // Try to remove the mut\n    (alias p).addOne ();\n//     ^^^^^\n// Try to remove the alias\n}\n\nAs you have guessed an object borrow data that are stored in the Heap,\nand is therefore a aliasable type. Everything that is applicable to\naliasable type Aliases is applicable to objects.\n1.4.

Let's start with the\nsimplest, the end of the list :\nclass None over Node {\n    pub self () {}\n\n    pub over append (self, i : i32) -> Node {\n        // We are at the end of the list\n        // we just have to return a node that contains the value\n\n        Some::new (i)\n    }\n\n    pub over print (self) {\n        print (\"END\");\n    }    \n}\n\nAnd the class Some, which contains a value: \nclass Some over Node {\n    let _value : i32;\n    let _next : Node;\n\n    pub {\n        /**\n         * This constructor is used when this node is the last value of the list\n         * It is followed by a None value\n         */\n         self (v : i32) with _value = v, _next = None::new () {}\n\n         self (v : i32, x : Node) with _value = v, _next = x {}\n\n\n         over append (self, i : i32) -> Node {\n             Some::new (self._value, self._next.append (i))\n         }        \n\n        over print (self) {\n            print (self._value, \"::\", self._next);        \n        }    \n    }\n}\n\nThere we are, the list is now usable:\ndef main () {\n    let x : Node = None::new ();\n    let y = x.append (12).append (8).append (3).append (9);\n    println (y);\n}\n\nYou should get the following output.\n12::8::3::9::END\nExercise: Without changing the main function, generate the\n  following result. In other words, change the append function, to\n  make sorted insertions.\n3::8::9::12::END\n"},"functions/":{"url":"functions/","title":"Function advanced","keywords":"","body":"1. Functions1.1. Function pointer1.1.1. Function pointer using reference1.2. Lambda function1.3. Closure1.3.1. Move closure1.3.2. Ref closure1. Functions\nWe have seen in the chapter Basic programming concepts how\nfunctions are written. In this chapter we will see more advanced\nfunction systems, named function pointer and closure.\n1.1. Function pointer\nA function pointer is a value that contains a function. It can be used\nto pass function as argument to other functions. The type of the\nfunction pointer is written using the keyword fn, and have the same\nsyntax as a function prototype, but without a name.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    f (41)\n}\n\ndef addOne (x : i32)-> i32\n    x + 1\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (&addOne);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nIn the above example, we have specified that the function foo take\nas parameter a function pointer, that takes an i32 and return a\ni32.\n1.1.1. Function pointer using reference\nFunction pointer can take reference parameters as normal functions.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (ref mut i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    let ref mut x = 41;\n    f (ref x);\n    x\n}\n\ndef mutAddOne (ref mut x : i32) {\n    x = x + 1;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (&mutAddOne);\n    println (x);\n}\n\n1.2. Lambda function\nLambda function are anonymous function that have the same behavior as\nnormal function, but don't have a name. They are declared using the\ntoken | surrounding the parameters instead of parentheses in order\nto dinstinguish them from tuple. \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x : i32, y : i32|-> i32 { \n        x + y\n    };\n    println (x (1, 2));\n}\n\nAs you may have noticed, there is no conflict between the variable x\ndeclared in the function main, and the first parameter of the lambda\nalso named x. In many cases the type of the parameters and return\ntype can be infered, and are therefore optional. The above example can\nthen be rewritten into :\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x, y| x + y;    \n    println (x (1, 2));\n\n\n    // The types are not given, then you can also write \n    println (x (1.3, 2.9));    \n}\n\nThe token => can be added after the prototype de make the lambda a\nbit more readable. It is just syntaxic and has no impact on the\nbehavior of the lambda.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x, y| => x + y;    \n    println (x (1, 2));\n\n\n    // The types are not given, then you can also write \n    println (x (1.3, 2.9));    \n}\n\nLambda function can evidently be used as function argument, like\nnormal functions.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (i32, i32)-> i32, x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 {\n    f (x, y) + f (y, x)\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (|x, y|=> x * y).foo (3, 7);\n    // Dotcall syntax, you can of course write it as follows : \n    // foo (|x, y| x*y, 3, 7);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nLambda function that are not typed are special element, that have no\nvalue. If it is not possible to infer the type of the lambda, and you\ntry to use it as a value, then you will get an error. Ymir allows\nto put an untyped lambda inside an immutable var, to ease its usage,\nbut the lambda still does not have any value.  With the following\ncode, you should get an error.\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x| x + 1;\n    let mut y = x;\n}\n\nError : type mut fn (any)-> any is not complete\n --> main.yr:(4,13)\n    | \n 4  |     let x = |x| x + 1;\n    |             ^\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(5,13)\n    | \n 5  |     let mut y = x;\n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nWhen you want to return a lambda function as a function value, you can\nhave the same error.  To avoid this, you can use the keyword \"return\",\nwhich will impose the type of the function return and allow an\nimplicit deduction of the lambda type. For example, the following code : \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> fn (i32)-> i32 {\n    return |x| => x + 12\n//  ^^^^^^\n// Try to remove the return here\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo ();\n    println (x (30));\n}\n\n1.3. Closure\nLambda function have no access on the scope of the function that\ndeclare them. If you try to compile the following program, you should\nget an error.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let i = 12;\n    let x = | | {\n        println (i);\n    };\n    x ();\n}\n\nThe variable i does not exist in the scope of the lambda function.\nError : undefined symbol i\n --> main.yr:(6,11)\n    | \n 6  |     println (i);\n    |              ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nClosure are a function pointer that capture the environment of the\nfunction that has declared them. There is two type of closure,\nreference closure and move closure.\n1.3.1. Move closure\nA move closure, declared by the keyword \"move\" followed by a lambda\nfunction, has access to the parent environment by value. All included\nvalues are immutable, and there is no way to make them mutable. A move\nclosure is safe to use, and in most cases totally sufficient, and is\npreferable to the reference closure.\nUnlike function pointer, the closure type is created with the keyword\ndg for delegate. A delegate is a function pointer with an\nenvironment, and is the general case of a closure.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : dg (i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    f (12)\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let i = 30;\n    let x = foo (move |x|=> x + i);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nMove closures can be returned safely, since the closure is done by\nvalue, there is no problem with the lifetime of the variables that are\nenclosed.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo ()-> dg (i32)-> i32 {\n    let mut i = 30;\n    return move |x : i32| x + i;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let z = foo ();\n    println (z (12));\n}\n\n1.3.2. Ref closure\nA ref closure is declared with the keyword ref instead of the keyword\nmove. As its name implies, a ref closure has access to the parent\nenvironment by reference. All included values are always immutable,\nbut a change in the parent environment will also have an impact on the\nenclosed environment. To clearly illustrate this behavior, the following\nsource code shows the difference between a ref closure and a move\nclosure.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut z = 1;\n\n    let m = move |x : i32| => x + z;\n    let r = ref  |x : i32| => x + z;\n\n    z = 30;\n    println (m (12));\n    println (r (12));\n}\n\n13\n42\nA ref closure is not safe to be returned, it enclose refence to local\nvariable. For the moment gyc does not provide static verification\nto ensure that no ref closure is returned, or at least that the ref\nclosure that is returned does not enclosed local variable whose\nlifetime will end with the end of the parent environment.\n"},"pattern/":{"url":"pattern/","title":"Pattern matching","keywords":"","body":"1. Pattern matching1.1. Matching multiple values1.2. Variable pattern1.3. Destructuring patterns1.3.1. Destructuring structure1.3.2. Destructuring class1. Pattern matching\nThe pattern matching is an important part of the Ymir language. It\nallows to make test over values and moreover on types, especially when\nit comes to objects. The pattern matching syntax always start with the\nkeyword match followed by an expression, and then patterns enclosed\nbetween {}.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    match (42) {\n        1 => println (\"The answer is one\");\n        2 => println (\"The answer is two\");\n        _ => println (\"I don't know, but neither one nor two...\")\n    }\n}\n\nMatch like every other element of the Ymir language are\nexpression. You can use a match to get a value, but all branch of the\nmatch must have the same type. If the case that the compiler is not\nsure that a branch will be entered and will return a value in every\ncase, you will get an error saying that the pattern matching does not\nhave a default value.\ndef main () {\n    let x = match (12) {\n        1 => 8\n        2 => 7\n        3 => 6\n    };\n}\n\nError : match of type i32 has no default match case\n --> main.yr:(2,13)\n    | \n 2  |     let x = match (12) {\n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n1.1. Matching multiple values\nYou can check multiple values in one pattern with the token |, which\nsemantic is the same as a or. You can also check interval using the\nkeyword .. and ....\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    match 42 {\n        1 .. 10 => {\n            println (\"The answer is between 1 and 10 not included\");\n        }\n        10 ... 40 {\n            println (\"The answer is between 10 and 40 included\");\n        }\n        41 | 42 | 43 => {\n            println (\"The answer is either 41, 42 or 43\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe pattern are tested in the order they are written, and the matching\nnever enter two different pattern even if two of them return a valid\nmatch.\n1.2. Variable pattern\nYou can use a variable that will take the value of the element that is\nmatched. The variable is declared like a standard variable declaration\nbut with token let ommitted. You don't have to specify the name or\nthe type of the variable, but there must be the token : somewhere,\nso if you don't wan't to specify the type, you can just use the token\n_.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    match 13 {\n        _ : i32 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, but I don't care about the value\");\n        }\n        _ : i32 = 13 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, whose value is 13\");\n        }\n        _ : _ = 13 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, whose value is 13, but I didn't checked the type\");\n        }        \n        x : i32 => {\n            println (\"It is a i32, and the value is : \", x);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn the above example, every test will pass, but only the first pattern\nwill be evaluated, and the output of this program will only be : It\nis a i32, but I don't care about the value \nYou can pass a value by reference in a pattern matching to modify it\ninside a valid pattern.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut z = 1;\n    match ref z {\n        // ^^^\n        // Try to remove the ref\n        ref mut x : _ => {\n            x = 42;\n        }\n    }\n\n    println (z);\n}\n\n1.3. Destructuring patterns\nThere are two types of destructuring patters, for tuple by using\npattern inside parenthese, or for structure and classes by using a\nCall syntax. When you want to destructure a tuple, you will just have\nto use parentheses that will surround any patterns, that are presented\nin this section.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let tuple = (1, 'x', 3.14)\n\n    match tuple {\n        (_ : i32 = 1, _, _) => {\n            println (\"This tuple has an arity of three and its first element is an i32, whose value is 1\");\n        } \n        (x : _, y : _, z : _) => {\n            println (\"This tuple has an arity of three, and its values are : (\", x, \", \", y, \", \", z, \")\");\n        }        \n    }\n}\n\n1.3.1. Destructuring structure\nThe destructurating of a structure is made like a call of the\nstructure. But you don't have to secify all the fields, but only those\nyou want to check.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct\n| x : i32\n| y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let p = Point (1, 2);\n\n    match p {\n        Point (y-> 1) => {\n            println (\"Point where y is equal to 1\");\n        }\n        Point (1) => {\n            println (\"Point where x is equal to 1\");\n        }\n        Point () => {\n            println (\"Any point\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nYou can of course with a variable pattern refer to the values later in\nthe pattern, for both the structure or even its fields. Reference\nvariable works the same as well.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct\n| x : i32\n| y : i32\n -> Point;\n\ndef main () {\n    let point = Point (1, 2);\n\n    match point {\n        p : _ = Point (y-> y : i32) => {\n            println (p, \" is a point, whose y field is equal to \", y);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n1.3.2. Destructuring class\nThe syntax for destructuring object is the same as the syntax for\ndestructuring structure. However, the parameters inside the\nparentheses will referes to object attributes that must be public in\nthe context of the pattern matching.\nimport std::io\n\nclass Point {\n    pub let x : i32 = 1;\n    let y : i32 = 2;\n\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let p = Point::new ();\n\n    match p {\n        Point (x-> 1) => {\n        //     ^\n        // Try to replace with y\n            println (p.x, \" is a equal to 1\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nUnlike structure destructuring, the type of the object is also\nchecked. It can be useful when dealing with inheritance. \nimport std::io\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Rectangle over Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo () -> Shape {\n    Circle::new ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let s = foo ();\n    match s {\n        Circle () => {\n            println (\"Foo returned a circle\");\n        }\n        Rectangle () => {\n            println (\"Foo returned a rectangle\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIt is the only way to check a inheritance in Ymir, and this way is\nsafe. In many language like Java, D or C++, you will have the right to\nuse the casting system, that will have a undefined behavior in C++,\nand make a program crash in Java, and will return the value null in\nD. Those three behavior are not acceptable since they are not\nsafe. The pattern matching will allow you to specify the behavior when\nthe cast has failed, for example, if you want to get the center of\ncircle :\nimport std::io\n\nimport std::io\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Rectangle over Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    pub let center : i32 ;\n\n    self (center : i32) with center = center {}\n}\n\n/**\n * Don't worry I will return you a circle\n*/\ndef foo () -> Shape {\n    Rectangle::new ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let circle = foo ();\n    let center = match circle {\n        Circle (center-> center : _) => center\n        _ => {\n            println (\"That's not a circle, foo lied!\");\n            0 // No need to have confidence in foo \n        }\n    };\n    println (\"The center of the circle is : \", center);\n}\n\n"},"templates/":{"url":"templates/","title":"Templates","keywords":"","body":"1. Templates1.1. Template argument syntax1.2. Template definition syntax1.3. Template instanciation1.3.1. Template class instanciation1. Templates\nThe templates system provide the possibility to reuse source code,\nthat is valid for multiple types. The template system of Ymir is\npowerful, and allows you to generate code, that will be used\nmany times for many purpose, by writting minimal source code. \n1.1. Template argument syntax\nThe template arguments are declared using the token !, followed by\none are multiple arguments, enclosed inside parentheses. Template\narguments are elements that must be known by the compiler at compile\ntime, in order to produce the template specialization and symbol\ndefinition. \nfoo!i32 (12); // One template argument (i32)\nfoo!(i32, f64) (12); // Two template arguments\n\nWhen the arguments, are also template, the parentheses are mandatory\neven if there is only one parameter, to avoid ambiguity.\nfoo!(foo!i32) (); // Ok\nfoo!foo!i32 (); // No\n\n1.2. Template definition syntax\nMultiple symbols in Ymir can be templates. Every template symbol\nhas a name, and the template parameters are following that name. For\nexample, function can be templates :\ndef foo (T) (a : T) {\n}\n\nIn the above example, we can see two set of parentheses, the first one\ndefine the template parameters, and the second one the parameters of\nthe function foo. Structure, class, enum, traits and internal\nmodules, can also be templates.\nclass A (T) {\n    let value : T;\n    // ...\n}\n\nstruct \n| x : T\n-> S (T);\n\nenum \n| X = cast!T (12)\n-> F (T);\n\nmod Inner (T) {\n    pub def foo (a : T) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\ntrait Z (T) {\n    pub def foo (self, a : T)-> T;\n}\n\n1.3. Template instanciation\nWhen a template symbol is defined, and the syntax of template call is\nused, a specialization is performed. The symbol, that match the most\nthe template arguments to the template parameter is chosen, and\ninstanciated. \nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!(i32) (12);\n}\n\nWhen the template symbol is a function, it can happened that the\ntemplate parameters can be infered from the parameters of the\nfunction. For example in the above example, there is no need to\nspecify a template call, and you can write as follows :\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (12); // T, will be infered to i32\n    foo (\"Hi !!\"); // T, will be infered to [c32]\n}\n\nThis cannot be done for structure or module. However, this is possible\nto do on classes, and this will be presented a little later, in the\nfollowing section of the document.\nWhen a template call is made on a function that take only one\nargument, you can use the DotCall syntax and forget the parameter\nparentheses. This can be used to simplify the syntax that is obvious\nanyway.\ndef foo (T, X) (_ : X) {\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    (12).foo!i32; \n    // It is exaclty the same as : \n    // (12).foo!(i32) (); \n}\n\nYou can note that only one argument has been passed to the template\nfunction. The second one is optionnal, since it can be infered from\nthe function parameter. If the function definition was foo (X, T)\n(_ : X), the inference could no more be done, the template call is\nchecked first, so X will be set to i32, and T could not be infered\nfrom anything, so you should get the following error :\nError : call operator is not defined for type foo (T)(_ : X)-> void and {i32}\n --> main.yr:(5,9)\n    | \n 5  |     (12).foo!i32; \n    |         ^\n    | Note : candidate foo --> main.yr:(1,5) : foo (T)(_ : X)-> void\n    | Error : unresolved template\n    |  --> main.yr:(1,13)\n    |     | \n    |  1  | def foo (X, T) (_ : X) {\n    |     |             ^\n    |------------------------------ \n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n1.3.1. Template class instanciation\nWhen a class template is declared, the compiler is sometimes able to\ninfer the type of the templates from the argument passed to the\nconstructors. The rule is the same as for function\ninstanciation. \nimport std::io;\n\nclass X (T, U) {\n    let x : T, y : U;\n\n    pub self (x : T, y : U) with x = x, y = y {}    \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = X::new (1, 'r');\n    let b = X::new ([1, 2], \"foo\");\n\n    println (a::typeinfo.name);\n    println (b::typeinfo.name);\n}\n\nLike functions you can make a two times validation of the templates of\na class. You don't have to give all the template parameters when\ninvoking a template call, but all the templates must be validated at\nthe end.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass X (T, U) {\n    let y : U;\n\n    pub self (y : U) with y = y {}    \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = X!(i32)::new ('r');\n    println (x::typeinfo.name);\n}\n\n"},"templates/special.html":{"url":"templates/special.html","title":"Specialization","keywords":"","body":"1.

Sometimes, you may want to\nbe more precize in the kind of type that can be used in a\nfunction. For example, when you want to sort an array, you don't wan't\nto be able to call the function with just a i32, but only with\narrays.\nThose kind of specialization can be achieved thanks to template\nspecifiers.\n1.1. Of specifier\nThe Of specifier declared with the keyword of, is used to tell to\nthe compiler that the type that will be used must fit to a specific\npattern.

The second and third\nones. The template definition that match the best the types, will be\nused. Here, this is the third one, so the ouput of the program will be : \nThird !\n1.2. Struct and Class specifier\nThe keywords struct and class can be used to specify that the\naccepted template argument must be respecitvely a structure or a\nclass type.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n-> X;\n\nclass A {\n    self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo (class T) () {\n    println (\"Class !\");\n}\n\ndef foo (struct T) () {\n    println (\"Struct !\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!(A) ();\n    foo!(X) ();\n}\n\n1.3. Implement specialization\nThe keyword impl can be used to check that the used type implement a\ndefined trait, for example :\nimport std::io;\n\ntrait Getter (T) {\n    def get (self)-> T;\n}\n\nclass A {\n\n    self () {}\n\n    impl Getter!i32 {\n        over get (self)-> i32 {\n            12\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef foo (T impl Getter!X, X) (a : T) -> X {\n    a.get ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new ();\n    println (foo (a));\n}\n\n1.4. Variadic templates\nVariadic templates are special templates, that takes an arbitrary\nnumber of template arguments. They are defined using the token ....\nThe parameters will be put in a tuple, and will be considered exaclty\nas if they were really a tuple. \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (T...) (a : T) {\n    println (a.0, expand a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n}\n\nAs you may have guessed by now, the println function is a variadic\ntemplate function. Variadic template can also be used on every\ntemplate symbol, like structures. \nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| foo : fn (T)-> i32 \n -> X (T...);\n\ndef add (x : i32, y : i32)-> i32\n    x + y\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = X!(i32, i32) (&add);\n    println (x.foo (12, 30));\n}\n\n"},"templates/cte.html":{"url":"templates/cte.html","title":"Compile time execution","keywords":"","body":"1. Compilation time execution1.1. Compilation time values1.2. Is operator1.3. Template function test1.4. Compilation time condition1.5. Class compilation test1. Compilation time execution\nIn Ymir, templates are seen as compilation time execution\nparameters. They can be used to create values, symbols, are to make\nthe compiler take decisions. \n1.1. Compilation time values\nBasically, every values can be know at compilation time as long as they do\nnot implies variable, or dynamic branching. For example this value\nfoo () acquired from the following source code can be known at\ncompilation time.\ndef foo () -> i32\n    bar () + baz ()\n\ndef bar () -> i32 \n    12\n\ndef baz () -> i32\n    30\n\nTo see if a value can be known at compilation time a simple test is to use\nit as a template parameter. Or by using the keyword cte.\nExercise : Try to compile the\nfollowing source code with the option -fdump-tree-gimple.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> i32\n    bar () + baz ()\n\ndef bar () -> i32 \n    12\n\ndef baz () -> i32\n    30\n\ndef printTemplate (V : i32) ()-> void {\n    println (V);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    printTemplate!(foo ());\n    let z = cte foo ();\n    println (z);\n}\n\nThis will generate a file named main.yr.004t.gimple containing a\nprecompiled version of the code. You should get in this file a\ndefinition of the function printTemplate, that prints the value\n42.\n// ...\n\nmain::printTemplate(42)::printTemplate ()\n{\n  {\n    _Y3std2io11printlnNi327printlnFi32Zv (42);\n  }\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n  {\n    signed int z;\n\n    _Y4main16printTemplateN4213printTemplateFZv ();\n    z = 42;\n    _Y3std2io11printlnNi327printlnFi32Zv (z);\n  }\n}\nThis chapter does not cover compilation time values, which will be\ndetailed in the next chapter, but it is important to know what a\ncompilation time value is in order to understand the following\nsections.\n1.2. Is operator\nThe is operator is used to perform a template test that will be\nevaluated to a bool value. This is useful for all of the following\nprinciples. The syntax is the following : \nis ! template_arguments templates_parameters\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) () {\n    let isI32 = is!(T) (X of i32);\n    println (isI32);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!i32 ();\n    foo!f32 ();\n}\n\n1.3. Template function test\nWhen declaring a function with the keyword def, you can add a test\nthat will be evaluated at compilation time, that will force the compiler\nto decide wether or not the symbol must be declared. \nimport std::io;\nimport std::traits;\n\ndef if (isIntegral!T) foo (T) (a : T)-> T\n    a + cast!T(30)\n\n\ndef main () {\n    println (foo (12));     \n}\n\nThe function isIntegral is declared within the module\nstd::traits. This module contains a list of compilation time definitions\nthat are designed to help for the specialization of templates . Each\nvalue that can be known at compilation time can be used in the test of a\nmodel function.\n1.4. Compilation time condition\nThe keyword cte in front of a if condition defines that the\ncondition test must be performed at compilation time. Only the block of\nthe condition that is satisfied will be compiled.\nimport std::traits;\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) (a : T)-> T {\n    cte if (isIntegral!T) {\n        a + 30\n    } else {\n        // Inconsistent operation on integrals\n        a [0]\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    println (foo (12));\n}\n\nAny condition that can be known at compilation time can be used as a test\nof a compilation time condition. \n1.5. Class compilation test\nThe keyword cte can also be used inside class definition to make\ndecision at compilation time. The syntax is the same as a compilation\ntime condition.\nimport std::io;\n\nclass Container (T) {\n    cte if !(is!(T)(X of void)) {\n        pub let value : T;\n    }\n\n    cte if !(is!(T)(X of void)) {\n        pub self (x : T) with value = x {}\n    } else {\n        pub self () {}\n    }\n\n    impl std::io::Printable {\n        pub over print (self) {\n            cte if (is!(T)(X of void)) {\n                print (\"Container!(void)\")\n            } else {\n                print (\"Container::value (\", self.value, \")\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = Container!(void)::new ();\n    let b = Container::new (42);\n\n    println (a);\n    println (b);\n}\n\n"},"templates/values.html":{"url":"templates/values.html","title":"Template as values","keywords":"","body":"1. Template values1.1. Compilation time variable1.2. Template type for compilation time variable1.3. Function as compilation time variable1. Template values\nIn the previous chapter, we saw that some values can be known at the\ntime of compilation. These values can be used for the compiler to\ndecide which part of the code should be compiled and which part should\nnot.\n1.1. Compilation time variable\nA compilation time value can also be passed as a parameter of a\ntemplate.  A template argument defined like a variable with the token\n:, will accept a compilation time value of the type that is\nspecified on the right operand. The left operand will then be an alias\nof the value, that will be pasted each time it is referenced in the\nbody of the template.\nFor example the following program, compute the value of fibonacci at\ncompilation time. You can see that the template fibo accept a\ncompilation time value of type i32.\nimport std::io\n\ndef fibo (N : i32) () -> i32 {\n    cte if (N == 0)\n        0\n    else cte if (N \nExercise : Try to remove the cte keywords in the example above.\nThe compilation time execution is really efficient, for example the following\ncode will compile without any problem.\nimport std::io\n\ndef fibo (N : u64) () -> u64 {\n    cte if (N == 0u64)\n        0u64\n    else cte if (N \n1.2. Template type for compilation time variable\nThe type of the compilation time variable can be a template. In that\ncase the system works like for Of specifier, and the template type\nmust be declared after in the template parameters. For example, the\nfollowing template function will accept any compilation time value.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (N : T, T) () {\n    println (T::typeid, \"(\", N, \")\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!(42);\n    foo!(\"Hi !\");\n}\n\nCompilation time values, can also be used to get an static array of a\nspecific size. This evidently works only on static arrays, and not on\nslice, because we need to know the size of the array at compilation\ntime.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (ARRAY of [T; N], T, N : usize) (a : ARRAY) {\n    println (\"Got an array of size : \", N);\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let array = [0; 10u64];\n    foo (array);\n}\n\n1.3. Function as compilation time variable\nStandard function and lambda function can be used as compilation time\nvalues. As for any other compilation time values, the variables are\ndeclared using the token : inside of the template parameters.  The\ntype of a compilation time function, is a function pointer, that is\nthus declared with the keywords fn. \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (FUN : fn ()-> T, T) () -> T {\n    println (\"Execution of a function : \");\n    FUN () + 30\n}\n\ndef bar (FUN : fn (X)-> T, T, X...)

Operator overloading\nThe operator overload is done by rewriting the operations applied on\nobjects operands. No new syntax is used for operator overloading. They\nuse compilation time values, and template definition to choose the\ncorrect operator.\n1.1. Unary operator\nThe overloading of binary operators is done by defining the opUnary function.\nIt is rewritten as follows: \n\n\n\nexpression\nrewrite\n\n\n\n\n-e\ne.opUnary!(\"-\")\n\n\n*e\ne.opUnary!(\"*\")\n\n\n!e\ne.opUnary!(\"!\")\n\n\n\nimport std::io;\n\nclass A  {\n    let a : f32;\n\n    pub self (a : f32) with a = a {} \n\n    pub def opUnary (\"-\") (self) -> A {\n    A::new (-self.a)\n    }\n\n    pub def opUnary (op : [c32]) (self) -> A {\n        if (op == \"!\")\n            A::new (1.f / self.a)\n        else\n            self\n    }\n\n    impl std::io::Printable {\n        pub over print (self) {\n            print (\"A(\", self.a, \")\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new (42.0f);\n    println (!a); \n    // This is exactly the same as : \n    // println (a.opUnary!(\"!\") ());\n}\n\n1.2. Binary operator\nBinary operators are also overloadable. As for unary operators, this\noverload can only be done on objects. They are rewritten with the\nfunction opBinary and opBinaryRight. The rewritte with a call to\nthe function opBinary is tested first, and if it does not compile,\nthen the rewritte with the call to the function opBinaryRight is\nthen tried.\nThe following operators are overloadable. The use indicated in the\nleft column is only an indication and corresponds to the common use of\nthese operators, but they can of course be used for other purposes.\n\n\n\nMath\n+\n-\n*\n/\n%\n^^\n\n\n\nBitwise\n|\n&\n^\n \n >> \n\n\n\nArray\n~\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>` |    `~` | `&`  | -->\nimport std::io;\n\nclass A {\n    let a : i32;\n\n    pub self (a : i32) with a = a {}\n\n    pub def opBinary (\"+\") (self, a : i32) -> A {\n        A::new (self.a + a)\n    }\n\n    pub def opBinaryRight (\"+\") (self, a : i32)-> A\n        self + a\n\n    pub def opBinary (\"-\") (self, a : i32) -> A {\n        A::new (self.a - a)\n    }\n\n    pub def opBinaryRight (\"-\") (self, a : i32)-> A\n        A::new (a - self.a)\n\n\n    impl std::io::Printable {\n        pub over print (self) {\n            print (self.a);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new (12);\n    println (30 - a);\n}\n\n1.3. Comparison operators\nThe comparison operators are also overloadable, but not like binary\noperators. The equality and comparison are treated via two different\nfunctions opEquals and opCmp. Because while almost all types can\nbe compared for equality, only some have meaningful order comparison. \nThe opCmp function is used for the operators , >,  and >=\nonly. And the function opEquals is used for the operator == and\n!=. When the method opEquals is not defined for the type, the\ncompiler will try to use the method opCmp instead. When both the\nfunction are defined, it is up to the user to ensure that these two\nfunctions are consistent.\nIndeed, it is impossible to verify that in a general case. You may\nwant for example to define a set object, where the operator x \nstand for x is a strict subset of y. Therefore, if neither x \nand y  are true, that does not implies that x == y.\n1.3.1. Overloading == and !=\nExpression of the form a != b, are rewritten into !(a == b),\ntherefore there is only one function to define. \nimport std::io\n\nclass Point {\n\n    let x : i32, y : i32;\n\n    pub self (x : i32, y : i32) with x = x, y = y {}\n\n    pub def opEquals (self, other : Point) -> bool {\n        self.x == other.x && self.y == other.y\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () throws AssertError {\n    let a = Point::new (1, 2);\n    let b = Point::new (2, 3);\n    let c = Point::new (1, 2);\n    assert (a == c);\n    assert (a != b);\n}\n\nThe operator opEquals is supposed commutative, so when the operator\nis only defined for the type on the right operand, the operation will\nsimply be rewritten reversely.\nimport std::io\n\nclass MyInt {\n\n    let i : i32;\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with i = i {}\n\n    pub def opEquals (self, i : i32) -> bool {\n        self.i == i\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () throws AssertError {\n    let mi = MyInt::new (8);\n    assert (8 == mi);\n}\n\n1.3.2. Overloading , =\nThose operators are overloadable by rewritting and calling the method\nopCmp. This method must return an signed integer element. The\nfollowing table presents how the operators are rewritten.\n\n\n\ncomparison\nrewrite 1\nrewrite 2\n\n\n\n\na \na.opCmp (b) \nb.opCmp (a) > 0\n\n\na > b\na.opCmp (b) > 0\nb.opCmp (a) \n\n\na \na.opCmp (b) \nb.opCmp (a) >= 0\n\n\na >= b\na.opCmp (b) >= 0\nb.opCmp (a) >= 0\n\n\n\nThe first rewrite is tried first, if it fails, the second is tested.\nIf the method opEquals is not defined the method opCmp will be\nused, and will be rewritten as a.opCmp (b) == 0.\nimport std::io\n\nclass MyInt {\n\n    let i : i32;\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with i = i {}\n\n    pub def opCmp (self, i : i32) -> i32 {\n        self.i - i\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () throws AssertError {\n    let mi = MyInt::new (8);\n    assert (7 \n1.4. Assignment\nThe assignment operator is not overloadable, it will always perform\nthe same operation. However, the shortcut operators +=, -=, *=\netc, are usable on object when oveloading the binary operator. In that\ncase, the method opBinary must return a mutable object.\nimport std::io\n\nclass MyInt {\n\n    pub let i : i32;\n\n    pub self (i : i32) with i = i {}\n\n    pub def opBinary (\"+\") (self, a : i32)-> mut MyInt {\n        //                                   ^^^\n        //                     Try to remove the mut there\n        MyInt::new (self.i + a)\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut mi = MyInt::new (8);\n    mi += 9;\n    println (mi.i);\n}\n\n1.5. Access operator\nThe operator of index [] is overloadable by the method\nopIndex. This method will simply be called with the parameters\npassed inside of the brackets. For example, the following operation a\n[b, c, d] will be rewrite into a.opIndex (b, c, d).\nimport std::io\n\nclass A {\n    let i : [i32];\n\n    pub self (a : [i32]) with i = a {}\n\n    pub def opIndex (self, x : i32) -> i32 \n        throws OutOfArray\n    {\n        self.i [x]\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws OutOfArray, AssertError\n{\n    let i = A::new ([1, 2, 3]);\n    assert (i [2] == 3)\n}\n\n1.6. Contain operator\nThe contain operator is a binary operator used to check if an element\nis inside another one. This operator is defined using the keyword\nin. Unlike other operator, the rewritte for the overloading is made\nonly once on the right operand, and call the method opContains. The\nexpression a !in b will be rewritten into !(a in b).\nclass A {\n\n    let a : [i32];\n\n    pub self (a : [i32]) with a = a {}\n\n    pub def opContains (self, i : i32)-> bool {\n        for j in self.a {\n            if (i == j) return true;\n        }\n        false\n    }    \n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws AssertError\n{\n    let i = A::new ([1, 2, 3]);\n    assert (2 in i);\n    assert (9 !in i);\n}\n\n"},"errors/main.html":{"url":"errors/main.html","title":"Error handling","keywords":"","body":"1. Error handling1.1. Rethrowing1.2. Catching exception1.2.1. Recovering with catch1.3. Mixin with type option1. Error handling\nThis section will introduce error handling in the Ymir\nlanguage. As with many languages, we have opted for error handling by\nthrowing exceptions. Error recovery is done in a localized way at the\nscope thanks to a system called scope guard.\nThe keyword throw is used to throw an exception when an error occurs\nin the program. An exception is a class that inherits the core class\ncore::exception::Exception. \nException are followed by the compiler, that will not allow you to\nforget the possibility that they may occur, and will force you to\nhandle them. There are two possibilities for error handling, either\nyou rethrow it in the function level by using the throws keyword,\neither you catch it with the keyword catch.\n1.1. Rethrowing\nThe error rethrowing is a way of defining that a function may throw an\nexception, and that this exception must be taking into account by a\ncaller function. It is a system relativelly similar to error\nrethrowing in Java, apart that the specific name of the exception\nmust be written in the possible rethrowed exception. That is to say,\nyou can't write that you want to rethrow any kind of exception, by\nwritting throws Exception. \nThanks to that, the compiler will always be able to check each kind of\nexceptions, and force the user to handle them.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) \n    throws AssertError\n{\n    assert (i \nAs previously stated, the name of the exceptions specified in the\nprototype function must be the actual name of the exception, not the\nname of an ancestor.\n\nclass ParentException over Exception {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\nclass ChildException over Exception {\n    pub self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo () \n    throws ChildException\n//         ^^^^^\n// Try to replace by Parent, or to remove just Exception\n{\n    throws ChildException::new ()\n}\n\n\ndef main () \n    throws ChildException\n//         ^^^^^\n//  Try to do the same here\n{\n    foo ()\n}\n\nThis system assure that, if a function is not marked as a throwing\nfunction, it is safe, and the program won't crash when calling\nit. Therefore, if the main function of a program is safe, then the\nprogram can't crash.\n1.2. Catching exception\nThe keyword catch define a catching block. It must follow a scope\ndefined by {}, and must catch all the exception that may occur in\nthat scope. The syntax of catching exception is similar to the pattern\nmatching.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () \n    throws AssertError\n{\n    assert (false);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n} catch {\n    _ : AssertError => {\n        println (\"Assert occured\");\n    }\n}\n\nThere are no implicit rethrowing of exception in a catch block, it is\nup to the user to force the rethrowing.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) \n    throws AssertError\n{\n\n    assert (i  i32\n    throws OutOfArray\n{\n    let i = [1];\n    i [9]\n}\n\ndef main () \n    throws OutOfArray\n{\n    foo (8);\n    bar ();\n} catch {\n    _ : AssertError => {\n        println (\"Assert occured\");\n    }\n    x : OutOfArray => {\n        throw x;\n    }\n    // Try to remove this second pattern match\n}\n\n1.2.1. Recovering with catch\nIn Ymir everything has a values, that is not different for a catch\nblock. When an error occurs, you may wan't to provide a default value,\nthat will help to recover from an error. The value of a catch block is\nthe value of the pattern matching it contains, and must have the same\ntype as the value of the block to which it is attached.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo ()-> i32 {\n    let i = [1];\n    i [9]\n} catch {\n    _ : OutOfArray => {\n        println (\"Out of array !\")\n        42\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (); // Call foo is safe\n    println (x);\n}\n\n1.3. Mixin with type option\nThe standard library provide an option type, in std::option. An\noption type is a monadic type, that may contain a value, or not. This\nis mainly used to handle errors when a computation might fail and\nreturn nothing.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) -> Option!i32 {\n    if (i \nIn Ymir you can easily transform an exception into an option type,\nby returning a None value, when an error occured. The function\ntoOption defined in the module std::option takes a function as\ntemplate argument, and transform the result of this function into a\noption type.

Scope guards1.1. Success scope guard1.2. Failure scope guard1.3. Exit scope1. Scope guards\nIn the last section we have seen the catch keyword that create a\nscope guard to catch exception that make occur in a specific scope. In\nthis section, we will introduce three different scope guards,\nsuccess, failure and exit.\nAs for the catch scope guard those are attached to a scope defined\nby {}. But unlike, the catch scope guard, they do not have impact on\nthe value of the scope to which they are attached.\n1.1. Success scope guard\nThe success scope guard is the simplest scope guard that exists, it is\njust a way to perform operation at the end of a scope if everything\nwent as wanted, and no exception has been thrown.\nimport std::io\n\ndef bar () -> i32 {\n    println (\"In bar\");\n    42\n}\n\ndef foo () -> i32 {\n    println (\"In foo\");\n    bar ()\n} success {\n    println (\"Exiting foo\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (); \n}\n\nThe scope success is the last thing executed in the block, so the\nresult will be the following.\nIn foo\nIn bar\nExiting foo\n1.2. Failure scope guard\nThe failure scope guard is the exact opposite of the success scope\nguard. It will only be triggered when an error occured in the scope to\nwhich it is attached. Failure scope guard does not catch exception,\nthey are just there to perform statements, when an exception has been\nthrown. \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) -> i32\n    throws AssertError\n{\n    assert (i \nThe assertion will failed, and the output will be the following : \nError in foo\nUnhandled exception\nException in file \"/home/emile/Documents/ymir/yruntime/midgard/core/exception.yr\", at line 38, in function \"core::exception::abort\", of type core::exception::AssertError.\nAborted (core dumped)\nA failure scope guard can evidently be attached only to scope that may\nthrow errors.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (i : i32) -> i32 {\n    42\n} failure {\n    println (\"Error in foo\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (12); \n}\n\nError : failure scope guard will never be triggered\n --> main.yr:(5,3)\n    | \n 5  | } failure {\n    |   ^^^^^^^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n1.3. Exit scope\nThe exit scope is a shortcut for both success and failure scope\nguards. It guarantee that an operation will be treated at the end of a\nscope, no matter what happened in the scope.  It is very useful for\nrelease tokens or handle at the end of a scope.\nimport std::io\nimport std::concurrency::sync;\n\nstatic m = Mutex::new ()\n\ndef foo (i : i32) {\n    {\n        m.lock ();\n        assert (i  {\n            println (\"catch : \", x);\n        }\n    } exit { // even if no assertion occured this will be triggered\n        println (\"Unlock : \", i);\n        m.unlock ();\n    } \n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (90);\n    foo (1);\n}\n\nResult : \nUnlock : 90\ncatch : AssertError ()\nUnlock : 1\n"}}}
