is a high level programming language, with static typing,\n  aiming to help developpers to gain time by proposing type safety,\n  and strong and safe semantic. The semantic of this language is\n  oriented on safety, concurrency and execution speed. Those\n  objectives are achieved thanks to its high expressivity and its\n  direct compilation to a efficient native machine language.\nThis documentation explores the main concept of Ymir, by proposing\na collection of examples that demonstrates the assets of this new\nlanguage. This travel, will presents some part of the standard library\nas well.\nInstallation\nThe reference compiler of Ymir is based on the compiler GCC,\nwhich offer strong static optimization, as well as a vast set of\nsupported target architectures.\nThere are two ways to install the gyc (Gnu Ymir Compiler), natively. Or by using a docker.\nNative installation\nThis compiler can be installed on linux debian system, by following those simple steps: \n\nFirst, you need to downloads the packages : \n\nlibmidgard-8-dev\nGYC\n\n\nAnd then, you need to install them using dpkg : \n\n\n$ sudo dpkg -i libgmidgard_8.2.0_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i gyc-8_8.2.0_amd64.deb\n\nThese packages depend on : \n\ng++-8\ngcc-8-base\nlibc6 >= 2.14\nlibgmp10 >= 2:5.0.1~\nlibisl19 >= 0.15\nlibmpc3\nlibmpfr6 >= 3.1.3\nzlib1g >= 1:1.1.4\nlibgcc1\nzlib1g-dev\nzlib1g >= 1:1.2.0\nlibgc-dev >= 1:7.4.2\n\nIf one of them is not installed, you will get an error, that can be resolved by launching the command : \nsudo apt --fix-broken install\n\nAnd then reinstall the package that has previously failed (dpkg).\nThe compiler is now installed and is named gyc\n$ gyc --version\n\ngyc-8 (GCC) 8.2.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nUninstallation of the native version\nAs for any debian package, the uninstall is done as follows : \n$ dpkg -r gyc-8\n$ dpkg -r libgmidgard-8-dev\n\nCaution The uninstallation can remove your gcc installation.\nBut you can still reinstall it easily if there is problem, by typing : \nsudo apt install --reinstall gcc-8\n\nDocker installation\nTo start you have to install docker.\n$ sudo apt install docker.io\n\nThen retrieve the docker image from the repository :\n$ docker pull gnuymir/8.2.0\n\nThe compiler is now accessible via the container.\n$ docker run -t -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp gnuymir/8.2.0 --version \ngyc-8 (GCC) 8.2.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nTo make it easier to use, you can add an alias in the ~/.local/bin directory.\n$ echo \"docker run -t -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp gnuymir/8.2.0 $*\" > ~/.local/bin/gyc-8\n$ chmod +x ~/.local/bin/gyc-8\n$ gyc-8 --version\n\ngyc-8 (GCC) 8.2.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

The type can be\nforced with the token :, but it must be compatible with the value. \nIf a variable is declared immutable, once a value is bound to it, it\ncannot change. In addition a variable must have an initial value, and\ncannot be declared without it.\nTo illustrate the variable declaration, you can try to run the following code. \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 2;    \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x);\n}\n\nYou should get the following error from the compiler : \nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(7,5)\n    | \n 7  |     x = 3;\n    |     ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nIn Ymir, the variable mutability and furthermore the type mutability\nguarantee by static verifications, that when you state that the value\nof a variable won't change it really won't change. Even if it can be a\nbit frustrating for the user sometimes.\nA variable is immutable by default, but sometime it can be useful to\nmake it mutable. To do so, you can use the keyword mut and\ndmut.  Mutability is applicable on types, and not only on\nvariables. The difference between these two keyword, is that\ndmut means the type of the variable is deeply mutable. The\nimmutability of a type is transitive, but this transitivity and what\nit implies will be explained in details in another chapter, since it\nis an advanced knowledge of the language Ymir.\nIf we take the same example as above, but with adding the keyword mut to the variable x.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = 2;    \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x);\n}\n\nThis time, you will not get any error, and the following output should\nappear when you run the program.\nX is equal to : 2\nX is equal to : 3\nThe mutability of variable can be very useful, but sometimes a bit\nhard to tackle when dealing with complex types. Ymir introduce\naliases types, that are explained in details in the chapter\nAlias and References\nGlobal variables\nGlobal variable are variables that are declared outside a function,\nthey can be used for multiple reasons. Those kind of variable are\ndeclared using the keyword static. \nAs for every variables, those one can be either mutable or not, but\nare immutable by default.\nimport std::io\n\nstatic pi = 3.14159265359\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Pi value is : \", pi);\n}\n\nShadowing and scope\nAll the variable that are not global, have a lifetime that is defined\nby their scope. A scope is a segment of code, that have a begin and an\nend, in which statement are made. More informations about scope will\nbe given in the chapter about function bodies, in\nFunctions. \nTwo variables with the same name cannot be declared in colliding\nscopes, that is to say, if a variable is declared with a name of a\nvariable currently alive in the current scope, a shadowing error will\nbe raised.\nTo illustrate that, copy and run the following program. \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 9;\n\n    let x = 12;\n}\n\nYou should get the following error, when compiling.\nError : declaration of x shadow another declaration\n --> main.yr:(6,9)\n    | \n 6  |     let x = 12;\n    |         ^\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(4,9)\n    | \n 4  |     let x = 9;\n    |         ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n"},"primitives/types.html":{"url":"primitives/types.html","title":"Data types","keywords":"","body":"Primitives types\nIn Ymir language every value has a certain data type, which tells\nthe behavior of the program, and how to operate with the\nvalue. Ymir is statically typed language, which means that all the\ntype of all values must be known at compile time. Usually the compiler\nis able to infer the data types of the values, and there is no need to\nspecify them when declaring a variable. But sometimes, when dealing\nwith variable mutability, or class inheritance, for example, the\ninference could be wrong, and the behavior not adapted to what you\ncould want to do.\nTherefore, the type can be added when declaring a variable, as in the\nfollowing code.\nlet mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2];\nlet mut y = [1, 2];\n\nTo understand the difference, between the type of x, and the\ntype of y, I invite you to read the chapter\nAlias and References.\nEach integer type has type attributs, which are accessible using the\noperator ::, on a type.\nlet a = i32::init;  // i32 (0)\n\nEvery primitive types have common attributes that are listed in the table bellow : \n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value of the type\n\n\ntypeid\nThe name of the type stored in a value of type [c32]\n\n\n\nScalar types\nScalar types represents all the types containing a single\nvalue. Ymir has four primitive scalar types : integers, floating\npoint, characters, and boolean. They can have different size for\ndifferent purposes.\nInteger types\nAn integer is a number whithout decimal part. There are differents\ninteger types in Ymir, the signed one, and the unsigned\none. Signed and unsigned refers to the possibilty of a number to be\nnegative. The signed integer types begins with the letter i,\nwhen the unsigned ones begin with the letter u. The following\ntable lists all the different integer types, and sort them by memory\nsize.\n\n\n\nsize\nsigned\nunsigned\n\n\n\n\n8 bits\ni8\nu8\n\n\n16 bits\ni16\nu16\n\n\n32 bits\ni32\nu32\n\n\n64 bits\ni64\nu64\n\n\narch\nisize\nusize\n\n\n\nThe type usize and isize are types that are architecture\ndependent, and have the size of a pointer.\nEach signed integer types, can store values from -(2 n - 1) to\n2 n - 1 - 1, where n is the size of the integer in\nmemory. Unsigned types, in the other hand, can store number going from\n0 to 2 n - 1. For example, the type i8, can store values\nfrom -128 to 127, and the type u8 values from 0 to 255.\nYou can write literal for integer in two forms, decimal 9_234 and\nhexadecimal 0x897A. The token _, is simply ignored in a integer\nliteral.\nTo ensure that the literal has the type you want, you will need to add\nthe type as a prefix of the literal. For example, to get a i8 with\nthe value 7, you will have to write 7i8. By default, if no\nprefix is added at the end of the literal, its type is considered to\nbe a i32.\nAs said above, each type has attributs, the following table lists the\nattributs specific to integer :\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nmax\nThe maximal value\n\n\nmin\nThe minimal value\n\n\n\nA capacity overflow verification is made on the literals, and an error\nis returned by the compiler if the type of integer you have chosen is\nnot large enough to contain the value. For example : \ndef main () {\n    let x : i8 = 934i8;\n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : overflow capacity for type i8 = 934\n --> main.yr:(2,18)\n    | \n 2  |     let x : i8 = 934i8;\n    |                  ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nHowever, if the value cannot be known at the compile time the overflow\nis not checked and can results in strange behaviour. For example, if\nyou try to add 1 to a variable of type i16 that contains the\nvalue 32767, the result will be -32768.\nFloating-point types\nThe floating point types, refers to the number having a decimal\npart. Ymir offers two floating point types, f32 and f64, that\nhave a respective size of 32 bits and 64 bits.\nYou can add the prefix f, at the end of a floating point literal\nto specify that you want a f32, instead of a f64 as it is\nby default.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 1.0; \n    let y : f32 = 1.0f;\n}\n\nThe following table list the attributes specific to floating point types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value - nan\n\n\nmax\nThe maximal finite value that this type can encode\n\n\nmin\nThe minimal finite value that this type can encode\n\n\nnan\nThe value Not a Number\n\n\ndig\nThe number of decimal digit of precision\n\n\ninf\nThe value positive infinity\n\n\nepsilon\nThe smallest increment to the value 1\n\n\nmant_dig\nNumber of bits in the  mantissa\n\n\nmax_10_exp\nmaximum int value such that 10^{max\\_10\\_exp} is representable\n\n\nmax_exp\nmaximum int value such that 2^{max\\_exp-1} is representable\n\n\nmin_10_exp\nminimum int value such that 10^{min\\_10\\_exp} is representable as a normalized value\n\n\nmin_exp\nminimum int value such that 2^{min\\_exp-1} is representable as a normalized value\n\n\n\nBoolean type\nA Boolean is a very simple type that can take two values, either true or false.\nFor example : \ndef main () {\n    let b = true;\n    let f : bool = false;\n}\n\nCharacter type\nThe c8 and c32 are the types used to encode characters.\nAs for integer literal, the prefix used to specify the type of a\ncharacter literal is c8, if nothing is specified the character\ntype will be c32. \nc32 character has a size of four bytes and can store any unicode\nvalue.  Character literals can have two forms, and are always surronded\nby the token '. The first form is the character itself r, and the\nsecond the unicode value in integer form \\u{12} or \\u{0xB}.\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺';    \n    let y = '\\u{0x263A}';\n}\n\nIf the characted literal is to long to be stored in the dezired type,\nan error will be returned by the compiler. For example :\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺'c8; \n}\n\nThe error should be the following, and it means that you will need at\nleast 3 c8 to store the value, and therefore it does not fit in\na single c8 :\nError : malformed literal, number of c8 is 3\n --> main.yr:(2,10)\n    | \n 2  |     let x = '☺'c8; \n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nCompound types\nUnlike the scalar types, compound contains multiple values.  There are\nthree type of compound type: tuple, range and arrays.\nTuple\nA tuple is a collection of values of different types. Tuples have\nfixed arity, once it has been set at compile time, it cannot be\nchanged. Each element of a tuple has a type, and its order equally\ncannot be changed. Tuples are constructed inside parentheses, by a list\nof values separated by commas.\ndef main () {\n    let t : (i32, c32, f64) = (1, 'r', 3.14); \n}\n\nThe tuple t, is a single element, and can be passed as function\nparameter or as a return value of a function. It also can be\ndestructured, in order to retreive the values of its composing\nelements. There is three ways to do that, the first one is by using the\ndot operator ., and an integer compile time known value.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let z : i32 = t._0;\n    let y : c32 = t. (0 + 1); \n    println (t.2);\n}\n\nThe other method is to used the tuple destructuring syntax, that will\ncreate new variables and therefore begins with the keyword let.\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let (x, y, z) = t;\n\n    let (f, e...) = t;\n    println (f, \" \", e.0);\n}\n\nIn the last example, we can see that the tuple destructuring syntax allows\nto extract only some of the values of the tuple. The value of e\nin this example will be ('r', 3.14).\nThe last method to extract values from tuple is with the keyword\nexpand, this keyword is a compile time rewrite and the following\nexample demonstrate how you can use it.\nimport std::io\n\ndef add (a : i32, b : i32) -> i32 \n    a + b\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (1, 2);\n    println (add (expand x)); \n\n    // Will be rewritten into :     \n    println (add (x.0, x.1));\n\n    // rewritter into : (1, x.0, x.1)\n    let j : (i32, i32, i32) = (1, expand x);    \n}\n\nRanges\nRange are types that contains two values defining an interval, and are\nnamed r!(T), where T is the type of the bounds of the interval. They\nare created by the token .. or .... A range is composed\nof four values, that are stored in the fields presented in the\nfollowing table.\n\n\n\nname\ntype\nvalue\n\n\n\n\nfst\nT\nthe first bound\n\n\nscd\nT\nthe second bound\n\n\nstep\nmut T\nthe step of the interval\n\n\ncontain\nbool\nIs the scd bound contained in the interval\n\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let range : r!(i32) = 1 .. 8;     \n    let c_range : r!(i32) = 1 ... 8;\n}\n\nThe function step_by take an interval as parameters and return a new\none, with a modified step.\ndef main () { \n    let range = (1 .. 8).step_by (2); \n}\n\nThe section Control flow shows a usage of those types. \nArrays\n An array is a collection of values of the same type, stored in\n contiguous memory.  Unlike Tuples, the size of an array is unknown at\n compile time, and in Ymir they are therefore similar to Slices.\n A slice is a two-word object, the first word is the length of the\n slice, and the second a pointer to the data stored in the slice. A\n slice is an aliasable type, its mutability is a bit more\n complicated than the mutability of scalar types, as it borrows memory\n that is not automatically copied when a affectation is made. This\n section will not talk about inner type mutability and aliasable\n types, so I recommand that you read the chapter\n Alias and References.\n The field len stores the length of the slice and can be\n retreived by the dot operator ..  The length of the slice is\n stored in a usize.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n   let x = [1, 2, 3];\n   println (\"The value of x : \", x); \n   println (\"The length of x : \", x.len);\n}\n\nEqually, the field ptr, give access to the pointer, of the slice\nand its types depend inner type of the slice, and is never mutable. For example : \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n   let mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2, 3];\n   *(x.ptr) = 8; \n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(6,4)\n    | \n 6  |    *(x.ptr) = 8;\n    |    ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nTo access array elements, the operator [] is used. It will take\neither a integer value, or a range value. If a range value is given, a\nsecond slice that borrow a section of the first one is created. For\nthe moment, the step of the interval does not affect the borrowing of\nthe array.\nimport std::io\ndef main () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let y = x [0..2];\n    let z = x [0];\n\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z); \n}\n\nThe operator ~ is used to make a concatenation of two arrays of the same type : \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> [i32] {\n    [8, 7, 6]\n}\n\ndef main ()  {\n    println ([1, 2, 3] ~ foo ());\n}\n\n"},"primitives/functions.html":{"url":"primitives/functions.html","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Functions\nFunction is a widely accepted concept for dividing a program into\nsmall parts. A ymir program starts with the main function that you\nhave already seen in previous chapters.\nAll functions are declared using the keyword def. And are called\nusing parameters separated by commas in parentheses.\nimport std::io \n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\ndef foo () {\n    println (\"Foo\");\n\n    bar ();\n}\n\ndef bar () {\n    println (\"Bar\");\n}\n\nThe declaration of a function can be done anywhere in the program, the\norder is not important for the compiler, so even if foo is declared\nafter the main function, it can be called without any problem.\nYou can also call a function using dotcall syntax, by placing the\nfirst parameter of the function on the left. This is a syntax used to\nperform continuous data processing and to make the source code easier\nto read.\nimport std::io\n\ndef plusOne (i : i32) -> i32 \n    i + 1\n\ndef plusTwo (i : i32) -> i32\n    i + 2\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 12;\n    x.plusOne ()\n     .plusTwo ()\n     .println ();\n}\n\nParameters\nThe parameters of a function are declared after its name, and the\nsyntax is similar to the declaration of a variable, but the keyword\nlet is omitted because it is obvious.\nimport std::io \n\ndef foo (x : i32) {\n    println (\"The value of x is : \", x);\n}\n\ndef bar (x : i32, y : i32) {\n    println (\"The value of x + y : \", x + y);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (5);\n    bar (3, 4);\n}\n\nValues can be specified on a function parameter. If a parameter has a\nvalue, it is the value that is used by default, and it is therefore\noptionnal to specify value when calling the function for that\nparticular parameter. If you still want to specify a value, you will\nhave to use a named expression that is formed using the token\n->.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (x : i32 = 8) {\n    println (\"The value of x is : \", x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n    foo (x-> 7);\n}\n\nThe named expression can equally be used for parameters that does not\nhave default value. A named expression will allow you to specify the\nparameter in the order you want. The algorithm, to determine which\nparameter an argument is refering to, is illustrated by the example : \ndef foo (x : i32, y : i32 = 9, z : i32) {\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (8, y-> 1, x-> 2);\n}\n\nThe algorithm is the following : \nLet args be the list of arguments ([y-> 1, x-> 2, 8])\nLet params be the list of parameters (x, y=9, z)\nLet final_args = [], be the list of final arguments\nfor each p in params :\n    for a in args :\n        if p.name == a.name : \n            final_args = final_args ~ [a]\n            remove p in params\n            remove a in args\n            found = true\n            break\n    if not found : \n        final_args = final_args ~ firstUnamedArg (args)\n        remove p in params\n        remove firstUnamedArg (args) in args\n\nIn this example, the result of each step will be : \n1, x : [x-> 2]\n2, y : [x-> 2, y-> 1]\n3, z : [x-> 2, y-> 1, 8]\nFunction body\nThe body of a function is an expression. Everything in ymir is an\nexpression, but every expression does not always have a value, and can\nbe of type void.\nA simple add function can be writter as follows : \ndef add (x : i32, y : i32)-> i32 \n    x + y\n\nOr using a more complex expression, as block, which is an expression\ncontaining a set of statements. A block is surronded by the tokens {},\nand the last expression in a block is its value. \ndef main () {\n    let x = {\n        let y = 9;\n        y + 1\n    }\n}\n\nThe token ;, is a way of specifying that an expression ends in a\nblock, and that the value of the block is the expression that\nfollows. If no expression follows the value of the block, it is evaluated\nto nothing and its type is void. For example, if we write the\nfollowing code :\ndef foo () -> i32 \n    9\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = {\n        foo ();\n    }\n}\n\nYou should get the following error from the compiler : \nError : cannot declare var of type void\n --> main.yr:(6,9)\n    | \n 6  |     let x = {\n    |         ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nFunction return type\nSometimes a function can return a value, the type of the value must be\ndefined at the end of the function definition before the value, by\nusing the token ->. The type of the value of the function must\nbe the same as the type defined in the prototype.\ndef foo (x : i32)-> i32 \n    x + 1\n\ndef bar (x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 {\n    let z = x + y;\n    println (\"The value of z : \", z);\n    foo (z)\n}\n\nThe keyword return is used to end a function prematurely.\ndef isDivisable (x : i32, z : i32) -> bool {\n    if (z == 0) return false;\n\n    (x % z) == 0\n}\n\nIf the value of function's body is not equivalent to the type\nof the function, and if there is a possibility that the function never\nencounter a return statement, an error is returned by the compiler. For\nexample with the following code :\nimport std::io\n\ndef add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    x + 1;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = add_one (5);\n    println (\"The value of x : \", x);\n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : incompatible types i32 and void\n --> main.yr:(3,29)\n    | \n 3  | def add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    |                             ^\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(5,1)\n    | \n 5  | }\n    | ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nBut if you change the last expression by a return statement, for example : \nimport std::io\n\ndef add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    if (x == 12) {\n        return x + 1\n    } else {\n        return x + 2\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = add_one (5);\n    println (\"The value of x : \", x);\n}\n\nThe compiler won't return any error.\nBlock declaration\nYou can declare functions, structs, etc. in a function. This is used\nto create symbol that are useful only for the current function. Sub\nfunction don't enclose the scope of the parent function.\ndef foo () {\n    import std::io;    \n    let x = 12;\n\n    def bar () -> i32 {\n        // Try to add the following line \n        // println (x);\n        12\n    }\n    println (x + bar ());\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n\n    // Try to add the following lines : \n    // bar ();\n    // println (\"In the main function !\");\n}\n\nThere is no way to retreive the symbol bar from outside the function\nfoo.

So, you\ncan initialize variable with a if, a while or even a for\nexpression.\nIf expression\nAn if expression allows you to branch in your code by making\ndecisions based on conditions. A if expression is composed by a if\nkeyword, followed by an expression that has to be typed as a bool,\nfollowed by a expression. You can add an else after an if\nexpression, to execute code, if the condition of the if expression\nis not respected.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 5;\n\n    if x \nYou can add an every expression you want after an else, for example another if.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 5;\n    if x \nAs said above, since everything is an expression, you can use if\nexpressions as values.

It is applicable on an\niterable type. The value of a \"for\" loop works exactly like the value\nevaluation of a \"while\" loop. Ranges, Slice and Tuple are iterable\ntypes.  For example, for range :\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    for i in (0 .. 8).step_by (2) {\n        println (i, \"!\");\n    }    \n\n    for i in 10 .. 0 {\n        println (i, \"!\");\n    }\n}\n\nYou can iterate one slice per value, by defining only one iterator on\nthe for loop.

It is important to\nunderstand how memory works in Ymir, in order to understand the\nerror message, you could get when trying to move data from one\nvariable to another.\nStandard and Aliasable types\nIn Ymir, there are two kinds of types, standard types and\naliasable types. The standard type, can be copied without explicitly\ninforming the compiler. These types, are all primitive types, except\nthe slices. On the other hand, aliasable types, are types that have\nborrowed data, which will not be copied, if not explicitly written\ninto the code, to avoid performance loss.\nTo understand how data is represented in a program, you need to know\nthe difference between heap and stack. The stack is a space allocated\nby the program when entering a function, which is released when the\nfunction is exited. On the other hand, the heap is a space that is\nallocated when certain instructions in the program require it, such as\ncreating a new array, creating a new object instance, and so on.\nWhen an array is created, all its data is stored in the heap, and the\naddress of this data is stored in the stack, where the variables are\nlocated. The following figure shows the data representation for this\nprogram:\ndef foo () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n}\n\n\nMutability level\nWe define the mutability level, as the deeper level in the type that\nis mutable. An example of mutability level is presented in the\nfollowing table : \n\n\n\nType\nLevel\n\n\n\n\nmut [i32]\n1\n\n\n[i32]\n0\n\n\nmut [mut i32]\n2\n\n\ndmut [[[i32]]]\n4\n\n\n\nThis is mainly used to ensure that borrowed data is not modified by\nanother variable, in external part of the program. The user has the\ncomplete control on the data he created. The example bellow shows an\nutilisation of the mutability level, to ensure that the content of an\narray is never modified.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = [1, 2, 3];\n    x = [2, 3, 4];\n    // Try to add the following line : \n    // x [0] = 8;\n}\n\nThe type of x in the previous example is mut [i32], we did not\nspecify mutability for the inner part of the array, so the compiler\nassumed that you don't want it to be mutable, for safety reasons. If\nyou have done the previous exercise, you should have got the following\nerror:\nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(7,7)\n    | \n 7  |     x [0] = 8;\n    |       ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nIt means that the data borrowed by x (and in this case are\nlocated in the Heap) are not mutable. \nDeep mutability\nEarlier we have introduce the keyword dmut, this keyword is used to\navoid very verbose type declaration, and tell that every sub type from\nthis point will be mutable. This keyword is applicable on every type,\nbut will have only effect on arrays and tuple.

Ymir offers a system of modules, which is used to manage\ndifferent parts of the code that have different purposes. Each source\nfile in Ymir is a module.\nFile hierarchy\nLet have a look at the following file hierarchy : \n.\n├── main.yr\n└── sub_modules\n    ├── bar.yr\n    └── foo.yr\n\n1 directory, 3 files\nIn this hierarchy we have three files, which contain modules, the\nfirst module in the file main.yr will be named main. The second\none in the sub_modules/bar.yr file will be named sub_modules::bar,\nand the third one in the sub_modules/foo.yr file will be named\nsub_modules::foo.\nTo be properly importable, the module must be defined from the\nrelative path of the compilation, i.e. if the file is located in\n$(pwd)/relative/path/to/file, its module name must be\nrelative::path::to::file.\nThe name of a module is defined by the first line of the source code,\nby the line keyword mod. If this line is not given by the user, the\npath of the module will only be the file name, so you will not always\nbe able to import the module, depending on its relative path.\nFor example, in the file foo.yr, the first line must look like : \nmod sub_modules::foo\n\nAnd, it will therefore be importable everywhere, for example in the\nmain module, when writing the import declaration :\nimport sub_modules::foo\n\nPrivacy\nAll symbols defined in a module are private by default. Only modules\nthat have declared the symbol have access to it. With the keyword\npub you can export the symbol for a external modules, which will then\nhave access to the symbol.\nFor example, with file foo.yr filled as follows : \nmod sub_modules::foo;\n\npub def foo () {}\n\ndef bar () {}\n\nAnd the file main.yr as follows : \nimport sub_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n//  ^^^\n// Try to replace foo by bar\n}\n\nThe main module, will only have access to the foo function, which\nis declared in the sub_modules::foo module. The keyword pub can be\nused as a block to cover multiple declarations :\nmod sub_modules::foo\n\npub {\n    def foo () {}\n\n    def bar () {}\n}\n\nSub modules\nIt is possible to declare sub-module that are part of a global module,\nwith the keyword \"mod\". Unlike global modules, you have to name them\nwhen you want to access the symbols declared inside them. For example :\nmod main\nimport std::io\n\nmod InnerModule {\n    pub def foo () {\n        println (\"Foo\");\n        bar ();\n    }\n\n    def bar () {\n        println (\"Bar\");\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    InnerModule::foo ();\n    //           ^^^\n    // Try to replace by bar\n}\n\nThe confidentiality system is the same as for the global module. A\nmodule is a symbol, so its privacy is the same as the privacy of\nfunctions, structure, class, etc. Only the main module will have\naccess to the sub-module InnerModule in the example above.\nSymbol conflict resolution\nWhen two external global modules declare two symbols with the same name,\nit may be impossible to know which symbol you want to use. In this\ncase, you can use the full name of the symbol to resolve the\nambiguity. For example, with the bar.yr file:\nmod sub_modules::bar\nimport std::io\n\npub def foo () {\n    println (\"Bar\");\n}\n\nAnd the file foo.yr : \nmod sub_modules::foo\nimport std::io\n\npub def foo () {\n    println (\"Foo\");\n}\n\nWhen using the symbol foo in the main module : \nimport sub_modules::bar, sub_modules::foo\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : foo called with {} work with both\n --> main.yr:(4,9)\n    | \n 4  |     foo ();\n    |         ^\nNote : candidate  --> main.yr:(4,9) : sub_modules::bar::foo ()-> void\nNote : candidate  --> main.yr:(4,9) : sub_modules::foo::foo ()-> void\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nYou can solve this problem, by replacing the call foo(), by sub_modules::foo::foo ().\nPublic importation\nAs for all declaration, importation are private. It means that the\nimportation is not recursive. For example, if the module\nsub_modules::foo imports the module sub_modules::bar, and the\nmodule main import the module sub_modules::foo, all the public\nsymbols declared in sub_modules::bar will not be accessible in the\nmodule main.\nYou can of course, make a pub importation, to make the symbols of\nthe module sub_modules::bar visible for the module main.\n\nsub_modules/foo.yr\n\nmod sub_modules::foo\n\npub import sub_modules::bar\n\n\nsub_modules/bar.yr\n\nmod sub_modules::bar\nimport std::io\n\npub def bar () {\n    println (\"Bar\");\n}\n\n\nmain.yr\n\nmod main\nimport sub_modules::foo;\n\ndef main () {\n    bar ();\n}\n\nInclude directory\nYou can use the -I option, to add a path to the include\ndirectory. This path will be used as if it was the current $(pwd). In\nother words, if you add the I -path/to/modules option, and you have a\nfile in path/to/modules/relative/to/my/file, the name of the module\nmust be relative::to::my::file.\ngyc -I ~/libs/ main.yr\n\nThis is how the standard library is included in the build, and how you\ncan access modules in std:: that are not located in $(pwd)/std/.\nCompilation of modules\nAll modules must be compiled, the import declaration will not\ncompile external modules.  For example, if you compile only the main\nmodule, you will get an error.\n\nmain.yr \n\nmod main\nimport sub_modules::foo;\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n}\n\n\nsub_modules/foo.yr\n\nmod sub_modules::foo\n\npub def foo () {}\n\n$ gyc main.yr\n/tmp/ccCOeXDq.o: In function `_Y4mainFZv':\nmain.yr:(.text+0x3e): undefined reference to `_Y11sub_modules3foo3fooFZv'\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\nThis means that the symbol foo declared in the module sub_modules::foo cannot be\nfound.

The methods are declared like function, but take the self\nas first parameter. The self type is not specified because it is\nobvious.\nclass Point {\n    // ... the same declaration as above\n\n    def vector (self, other : Point) -> Point {\n        Point::new (other._x - self._x, other._y - self._y)\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let p1 = Point::new (1, 2), p2 = Point::new (2, 3);\n    let v = p1.vector (p2);\n}\n\nThe self instance is an alias of the object (Cf. Aliases),\nthat is immutable by default. You can make it mutable by using the\nkeyword mut. As for structure, the attributes mutability is defined\nwhen declaring them. If an attribute is mutable, its mutability\ndepends on the mutability of the object instance that posses it.\nclass Point {\n    let mut _x : i32, mut _y = 0;\n\n    // ... the same constructors as above\n\n    def addOne (mut self) {\n    //          ^^^\n    // Try to remove the mut \n\n        self._x += 1;\n        self._y += 1;\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut p = Point::new (1, 2);\n    //  ^^^\n    // Try to remove the mut\n    (alias p).addOne ();\n//     ^^^^^\n// Try to remove the alias\n}\n\nAs you have guessed an object borrow data that are stored in the Heap,\nand is therefore a aliasable type. Everything that is applicable to\naliasable type Aliases is applicable to objects.\nDestructors\nThere is no destructor in Ymir, the object instances are destroyed\nby the garbage collector.\n"},"objects/inheritance.html":{"url":"objects/inheritance.html","title":"Inheritance","keywords":"","body":"Inheritance\nA class can be derived from a base class.

In this chapter we will see more advanced\nfunction systems, named function pointer and closure.\nFunction pointer\nA function pointer is a value that contains a function. It can be used\nto pass function as argument to other functions. The type of the\nfunction pointer is written using the keyword fn, and have the same\nsyntax as a function prototype, but without a name.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    f (41)\n}\n\ndef addOne (x : i32)-> i32\n    x + 1\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (&addOne);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nIn the above example, we have specified that the function foo take\nas parameter a function pointer, that takes an i32 and return a\ni32.\nFunction pointer using reference\nFunction pointer can take reference parameters as normal functions.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (ref mut i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    let ref mut x = 41;\n    f (ref x);\n    x\n}\n\ndef mutAddOne (ref mut x : i32) {\n    x = x + 1;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo (&mutAddOne);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nLambda function\nLambda function are anonymous function that have the same behavior as\nnormal function, but don't have a name. They are declared using the\ntoken | surrounding the parameters instead of parentheses in order\nto dinstinguish them from tuple. \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x : i32, y : i32|-> i32 { \n        x + y\n    };\n    println (x (1, 2));\n}\n\nAs you may have noticed, there is no conflict between the variable x\ndeclared in the function main, and the first parameter of the lambda\nalso named x. In many cases the type of the parameters and return\ntype can be infered, and are therefore optional. The above example can\nthen be rewritten into :\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x, y| x + y;    \n    println (x (1, 2));\n\n\n    // The types are not given, then you can also write \n    println (x (1.3, 2.9));    \n}\n\nThe token => can be added after the prototype de make the lambda a\nbit more readable. It is just syntaxic and has no impact on the\nbehavior of the lambda.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x, y| => x + y;    \n    println (x (1, 2));\n\n\n    // The types are not given, then you can also write \n    println (x (1.3, 2.9));    \n}\n\nLambda function can evidently be used as function argument, like\nnormal functions.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : fn (i32, i32)-> i32, x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 {\n    f (x, y) + f (y, x)\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (|x, y|=> x * y).foo (3, 7);\n    // Dotcall syntax, you can of course write it as follows : \n    // foo (|x, y| x*y, 3, 7);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nLambda function that are not typed are special element, that have no\nvalue. If it is not possible to infer the type of the lambda, and you\ntry to use it as a value, then you will get an error. Ymir allows\nto put an untyped lambda inside an immutable var, to ease its usage,\nbut the lambda still does not have any value.  With the following\ncode, you should get an error.\ndef main () {\n    let x = |x| x + 1;\n    let mut y = x;\n}\n\nError : type mut fn (any)-> any is not complete\n --> main.yr:(4,13)\n    | \n 4  |     let x = |x| x + 1;\n    |             ^\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(5,13)\n    | \n 5  |     let mut y = x;\n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nWhen you want to return a lambda function as a function value, you can\nhave the same error.  To avoid this, you can use the keyword \"return\",\nwhich will impose the type of the function return and allow an\nimplicit deduction of the lambda type. For example, the following code : \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> fn (i32)-> i32 {\n    return |x| => x + 12\n//  ^^^^^^\n// Try to remove the return here\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = foo ();\n    println (x (30));\n}\n\nClosure\nLambda function have no access on the scope of the function that\ndeclare them. If you try to compile the following program, you should\nget an error.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let i = 12;\n    let x = | | {\n        println (i);\n    };\n    x ();\n}\n\nThe variable i does not exist in the scope of the lambda function.\nError : undefined symbol i\n --> main.yr:(6,11)\n    | \n 6  |     println (i);\n    |              ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nClosure are a function pointer that capture the environment of the\nfunction that has declared them. There is two type of closure,\nreference closure and move closure.\nMove closure\nA move closure, declared by the keyword \"move\" followed by a lambda\nfunction, has access to the parent environment by value. All included\nvalues are immutable, and there is no way to make them mutable. A move\nclosure is safe to use, and in most cases totally sufficient, and is\npreferable to the reference closure.\nUnlike function pointer, the closure type is created with the keyword\ndg for delegate. A delegate is a function pointer with an\nenvironment, and is the general case of a closure.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (f : dg (i32)-> i32) -> i32 {\n    f (12)\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let i = 30;\n    let x = foo (move |x|=> x + i);\n    println (x);\n}\n\nMove closures can be returned safely, since the closure is done by\nvalue, there is no problem with the lifetime of the variables that are\nenclosed.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo ()-> dg (i32)-> i32 {\n    let mut i = 30;\n    return move |x : i32| x + i;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let z = foo ();\n    println (z (12));\n}\n\nRef closure\nA ref closure is declared with the keyword ref instead of the keyword\nmove. As its name implies, a ref closure has access to the parent\nenvironment by reference. All included values are always immutable,\nbut a change in the parent environment will also have an impact on the\nenclosed environment. To clearly illustrate this behavior, the following\nsource code shows the difference between a ref closure and a move\nclosure.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut z = 1;\n\n    let m = move |x : i32| => x + z;\n    let r = ref  |x : i32| => x + z;\n\n    z = 30;\n    println (m (12));\n    println (r (12));\n}\n\n13\n42\nA ref closure is not safe to be returned, it enclose refence to local\nvariable. For the moment gyc does not provide static verification\nto ensure that no ref closure is returned, or at least that the ref\nclosure that is returned does not enclosed local variable whose\nlifetime will end with the end of the parent environment.\n"},"pattern/":{"url":"pattern/","title":"Pattern matching","keywords":"","body":"Pattern matching\nThe pattern matching is an important part of the Ymir language.

However, the parameters inside the\nparentheses will referes to object attributes that must be public in\nthe context of the pattern matching.\nimport std::io\n\nclass Point {\n    pub let x : i32 = 1;\n    let y : i32 = 2;\n\n    self () {}\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let p = Point::new ();\n\n    match p {\n        Point (x-> 1) => {\n        //     ^\n        // Try to replace with y\n            println (p.x, \" is a equal to 1\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nUnlike structure destructuring, the type of the object is also\nchecked. It can be useful when dealing with inheritance. \nimport std::io\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Rectangle over Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo () -> Shape {\n    Circle::new ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let s = foo ();\n    match s {\n        Circle () => {\n            println (\"Foo returned a circle\");\n        }\n        Rectangle () => {\n            println (\"Foo returned a rectangle\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIt is the only way to check a inheritance in Ymir, and this way is\nsafe. In many language like Java, D or C++, you will have the right to\nuse the casting system, that will have a undefined behavior in C++,\nand make a program crash in Java, and will return the value null in\nD. Those three behavior are not acceptable since they are not\nsafe. The pattern matching will allow you to specify the behavior when\nthe cast has failed, for example, if you want to get the center of\ncircle :\nimport std::io\n\nimport std::io\n\nclass @abstract Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Rectangle over Shape {\n    self () {}\n}\n\nclass Circle over Shape {\n    pub let center : i32 ;\n\n    self (center : i32) with center = center {}\n}\n\n/**\n * Don't worry I will return you a circle\n*/\ndef foo () -> Shape {\n    Rectangle::new ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let circle = foo ();\n    let center = match circle {\n        Circle (center-> center : _) => center\n        _ => {\n            println (\"That's not a circle, foo lied!\");\n            0 // No need to have confidence in foo \n        }\n    };\n    println (\"The center of the circle is : \", center);\n}\n\n"},"templates/":{"url":"templates/","title":"Templates","keywords":"","body":"Templates\nThe templates system provide the possibility to reuse source code,\nthat is valid for multiple types. The template system of Ymir is\npowerful, and allows you to generate code, that will be used\nmany times for many purpose, by writting minimal source code. \nTemplate argument syntax\nThe template arguments are declared using the token !, followed by\none are multiple arguments, enclosed inside parentheses. Template\narguments are elements that must be known by the compiler at compile\ntime, in order to produce the template specialization and symbol\ndefinition. \nfoo!i32 (12); // One template argument (i32)\nfoo!(i32, f64) (12); // Two template arguments\n\nWhen the arguments, are also template, the parentheses are mandatory\neven if there is only one parameter, to avoid ambiguity.\nfoo!(foo!i32) (); // Ok\nfoo!foo!i32 (); // No\n\nTemplate definition syntax\nMultiple symbols in Ymir can be templates. Every template symbol\nhas a name, and the template parameters are following that name. For\nexample, function can be templates :\ndef foo (T) (a : T) {\n}\n\nIn the above example, we can see two set of parentheses, the first one\ndefine the template parameters, and the second one the parameters of\nthe function foo. Structure, class, enum and internal modules, can\nalso be templates.\nclass A (T) {\n    let value : T;\n    // ...\n}\n\nstruct \n| x : T\n-> S (T);\n\nenum \n| X = cast!T (12)\n-> F (T);\n\nmod Inner (T) {\n    pub def foo (a : T) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nTemplate instanciation\nWhen a template symbol is defined, and the syntax of template call is\nused, a specialization is performed. The symbol, that match the most\nthe template arguments to the template parameter is chosen, and\ninstanciated. \nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!(i32) (12);\n}\n\nWhen the template symbol is a function, it can happened that the\ntemplate parameters can be infered from the parameters of the\nfunction. For example in the above example, there is no need to\nspecify a template call, and you can write as follows :\nimport std::io;\n\ndef foo (T) (a : T) {\n    println (a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (12); // T, will be infered to i32\n    foo (\"Hi !!\"); // T, will be infered to [c32]\n}\n\nThis cannot be done for class, structure or module. However, there is\na work in progress to implement that behavior for structure and class.\nWhen a template call is made on a function that take only one\nargument, you can use the DotCall syntax and forget the parameter\nparentheses. This can be used to simplify the syntax that is obvious\nanyway.\ndef foo (T, X) (_ : X) {\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    (12).foo!i32; \n    // It is exaclty the same as : \n    // (12).foo!(i32) (); \n}\n\nYou can note that only one argument has been passed to the template\nfunction. The second one is optionnal, since it can be infered from\nthe function parameter. If the function definition was foo (X, T)\n(_ : X), the inference could no more be done, the template call is\nchecked first, so X will be set to i32, and T could not be infered\nfrom anything, so you should get the following error :\nError : call operator is not defined for type none and {i32}\n --> main.yr:(5,6)\n    | \n 5  |     (12).foo!i32; \n    |         ^\n    | Note : candidate foo --> main.yr:(1,5) : none\n    | Error : unresolved template\n    |  --> main.yr:(1,13)\n    |     | \n    |  1  | def foo (X, T) (_ : X) {\n    |     |             ^\n    |------------------------------ \n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n"},"templates/special.html":{"url":"templates/special.html","title":"Specialization","keywords":"","body":"Template specialization\nWe have seen in the last chapter, how to create simple template\nfunction, that can be call with any type. Sometimes, you may want to\nbe more precize in the kind of type that can be used in a\nfunction. For example, when you want to sort an array, you don't wan't\nto be able to call the function with just a i32, but only with\narrays.\nThose kind of specialization can be achieved thanks to template\nspecifiers.\nOf specifier\nThe Of specifier declared with the keyword of, is used to tell to\nthe compiler that the type that will be used must fit to a specific\npattern. It can be either a type, or a more specific template.\nimport std::io;\n\n/**\n * This function will only be callable, with a i32 as T\n */\ndef foo (T of i32) (_ : T) {\n    println (\"First ??\");\n}\n\n/**\n * This function will only be callable, with a type that fit the Z pattern\n * That is to say every type\n */\ndef foo (T of Z, Z) (_ : T) {\n    println (\"Second ?\");\n}\n\n/**\n * This function will be only callable, with an array of Z, where Z can be anything\n */\ndef foo (T of [Z], Z) (_ : T) {\n    println (\"Third !\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ([1, 2]);\n}\n\nIn the above example, you may have noticed that, two functions can be\ncalled by the expression foo ([1, 2]). The second and third\nones. The template definition that match the best the types, will be\nused. Here, this is the third one, so the ouput of the program will be : \nThird !\nStruct and Class specifier\nThe keywords struct and class can be used to specify that the\naccepted template argument must be respecitvely a structure or a\nclass type.\nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| x : i32\n-> X;\n\nclass A {\n    self () {}\n}\n\ndef foo (class T) () {\n    println (\"Class !\");\n}\n\ndef foo (struct T) () {\n    println (\"Struct !\");\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo!(A) ();\n    foo!(X) ();\n}\n\nImplement specialization\nThe keyword impl can be used to check that the used type implement a\ndefined trait, for example :\nimport std::io;\n\ntrait Getter (T) {\n    def get (self)-> T;\n}\n\nclass A {\n\n    self () {}\n\n    impl Getter!i32 {\n        over get (self)-> i32 {\n            12\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\ndef foo (T impl Getter!X, X) (a : T) -> X {\n    a.get ()\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let a = A::new ();\n    println (foo (a));    \n}\n\nVariadic templates\nVariadic templates are special templates, that takes an arbitrary\nnumber of template arguments. They are defined using the token ....\nThe parameters will be put in a tuple, and will be considered exaclty\nas if they were really a tuple. \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (T...) (a : T) {\n    println (a.0, expand a);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n}\n\nAs you may have guessed by now, the println function is a variadic\ntemplate function. Variadic template can also be used on every\ntemplate symbol, like structures. \nimport std::io\n\nstruct \n| foo : fn (T)-> i32 \n -> X (T...);\n\ndef add (x : i32, y : i32)-> i32\n    x + y\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = X!(i32, i32) (&add);\n    println (x.foo (12, 30));\n}\n\nConclusion\nTemplates in Ymir are very powerful and can offer a multitude of\npossibilities. They are very useful, and most part of the standard\nlibrarie is written exclusively with templates. They should be used\nwhenever possible, to provide reusable code, which can be shared\nbetween several types, to do code factorization and avoid error\npropagation.\n"}}}
