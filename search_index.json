is a high level programming language, with static typing,\n  aiming to help developpers to gain time by proposing type safety,\n  and strong and safe semantic. The semantic of this language is\n  oriented on safety, concurrency and execution speed. Those\n  objectives are achieved thanks to its high expressivity and its\n  direct compilation to a efficient native machine language.\nThis documentation explores the main concept of Ymir, by proposing\na collection of examples that demonstrates the assets of this new\nlanguage. This travel, will presents some part of the standard library\nas well.\nInstallation\nThe reference compiler of Ymir is based on the compiler GCC,\nwhich offer strong static optimization, as well as a vast set of\nsupported target architectures.\nThis compiler can be installed on linux debian system, by following those simple steps: \n\nFirst, you need to downloads the packages : \n\nlibmidgard-7-dev\nGYC\n\n\nAnd then, you need to install them using dpkg : \n\n\n$ sudo dpkg -i libgmidgard_7.3.0_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i gyc-7_7.3.0_amd64.deb\n\nThe compiler is now installed and is named gyc-7\n$ gyc-7 --version\n\ngyc-7 (Ubuntu 7.3.0-16ubuntu3) 7.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

This system can be used in ymir, thanks to the operator ....\nA very simple example in C, is the call of the function printf, which is a variadic function, and therefore takes an arbitrary number of arguments as input.\nextern (C) printf (const format : p!char, ...); \n\nlet i = 0, j = 12.3f;\nprintf (\"My int is equals to %d, and my float to %f\".ptr, i, j);\n\nFunction overloading\nAll functions can be overloaded, whether pure or not. During the call, the function closest to the types passed as parameter will be called.\ndef foo (a : i32, b) {\n// ...\n}\n\ndef foo (a, b : i32) {\n// ...\n}\n\n//...\nfoo (10, \"salut\"); // the first function is called\nfoo (\"salut\", 10); // the second function is called\nfoo (10, 10); // Error, the overload works as well with both prototypes.\n\nParameter decorator\nThere are three parameter decorators to specify a behavior \n\nconst, the parameter cannot be modified whatever its type (cf.Variables)\nref, the parameter is passed by reference, a lvalue is required. Any modification of the variable in the called function will also modify the variable of the calling function.\nWe can also consider the lazy decorator, which will be detailed in another section\n\ndef foo (ref a) {\n    a = 12;\n}\n\ndef bar (const a : [i32]) {\n    a [0] = 8; // Error the table is constant\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nfoo (10); // Error, 10 is not a lvalue\nfoo (a);\nassert (a == 12);\n\nbar ([1, 2, 3]); // Ok\n\nThe const decorator is transitive and not removable.\ndef foo (a : [char]) {\n    // ...\n}\n\ndef bar (const a : [char]) {\n    // ...\n}\n\nlet a = \"test\"; // [const (char)];\nfoo (a); // Error, we lose the const\nbar (a); // Ok, the const is transitive, const ([char]) is more global than [const (char)]\n\nlet b = [char ; new 10U]; // [char]\nbar (b); // Okay, you can pass a non-constant element as a constant element\n\n"},"fonctions/attributs.html":{"url":"fonctions/attributs.html","title":"Attributs","keywords":"","body":"Function attributes\nThe functions can be configured using attributes.

In other words, unlike a normal function call, the body of the function will be pasted into the caller's function. \ndef @inline foo (a : i32) {\n    return a + 12;\n}\n\nprintln (foo (10));\n\nWill be rewritten in : \nprintln (22);\n\nIt is impossible to inline a recursive function, but all other functions can be inlined.

They are declared in the body of other functions, and can be assigned in variables.  These functions can be cte under certain conditions, and under other conditions allow the management of an environment named closure.\nDefinition of a lambda function\nThe syntax of a lambda function is as follows: \nlet ld = (x : i32) => x + 1;\n\nassert (ld (2) == 3);\n\nThe variable ld, is a pointer to a function, of the type fn (i32)-> i32. As the value of this variable is a function, it can be considered as known at compile time.\nTherefore it is also possible to write: \nlet cte ld = (x : i32) => x + 1;\n\nassert (ld (2) == 3);\n\nThe difference in the second case is how the call will be handled. When in the first case, the call is made via the dereferencing of a pointer to function (which is unsafe), in the second case the call is written directly during the compilation phase.\nIt is possible to describe a lambda function on several lines, so that it performs more than one operation.\nlet ld = (x : i32) {\n    for i in 0 .. x {\n        println (i);\n    }\n    return x + 1;\n};\n\nprintln (ld (2)); // 0 1 3\n\nThe lambda functions can also be impure, and the type of parameters is optional. However, when an impure lambda is declared, it must be annotated as known at compilation and cannot be assigned to a dynamic variable.\nlet cte ld1 = (x) => x + 1;\n\nassert (ld1 (2) == 3);\n\nlet ld2 = (x) => x + 1; // Error, we can't create a pointer to a function if we don't know the type of parameters\n\nClosure\nThe closure are particular lambda functions called so because it closes their environment. They are also called delegate and the keyword dg refers to a pointer to a closure.\nlet num = 10;\nlet closure = (x : i32) => x + num;\n\nassert (closure (10) == 20);\n\nThe num variable is copied to the lambda function, which allows the function to recover its value. Copy closures can be returned without any problem from a function.\ndef retClosure () -> dg (i32)-> i32 {\n    let num = 10;\n    return (x : i32) => x + num;\n}\n\nlet closure = retClosure ();\nassert (closure (10) == 20);\n\nClosure by reference\nClosures by reference are closures that access their environment by reference. This access allows you to modify the value of local variables in an environment.\ndef transform (closure : dg (i32) -> void, len : i32) {\n    for i in 0 .. len {\n        closure (i);\n    }\n}\n\nlet myArray = [0, 0, 0, 0];\nlet closure = ref (i : i32) { myArray [i] = i + 1; };\n\ntransform (closure, 4);\nassert (myArray == [1, 2, 3, 4]);\n\nUnlike copy closure, reference closures sometimes cannot be returned from a function. Indeed, the lifetime of the local variables at the function never exceeds the lifetime of the function.\ndef foo () -> dg (i32)-> void {\n    let x = 12;\n    return ref (i : i32) { println (i + x); }; // Error, Closure var 'x' does not live long enough\n}\n\n"},"types-personnalises/main.html":{"url":"types-personnalises/main.html","title":"Custom types","keywords":"","body":"Custom types\nThis section will present different constructions to add new types. \nIt includes: \n\nThe structures\nThe unions \nThe enums\n\n"},"types-personnalises/structures.html":{"url":"types-personnalises/structures.html","title":"Structures","keywords":"","body":"Structures\nA structure is a custom type, allowing you to group several values into a type with a name.

They make it possible to apply a particular treatment to a type and facilitate the structuring of the code.\nPure methods\nAs for functions, methods are separated into two categories, pure methods and impure methods (see Functions).\nPure methods are defined in a class using the keyword def. The first parameter of a method is always self, its type is a reference of an object, and is always inferred.\n\ntype MyType impl (i32) {\n\n    self (x : i32) { self.0 = x; }\n\n    def foo (self, z : i32) {\n        println (\"Replace \", self.0, \" by \", z);\n        self.0 = z;\n    }\n\n}\n\n// ...\n\nlet myvar = MyType::init (10);\nmyvar.foo (12); // This prints : 'Replace 10 by 12'\n\nIt is possible to define several methods with the same name, as for functions. The method that is closest to type specialization during a call, or reference, will be used.\nWe will see later that it is also possible to override a method with inheritance.\nOnly pure methods can be overrided by inheritance, because they alone are virtual.\nImpure methods\nAs for the declaration of pure methods, the keyword def allows to declare an impure method. The difference between a pure method and an impure method is the same as the difference between pure and impure functions, so you can refer to the section Function, for more details.\n\ntype MyType impl (i32) {\n\n    // ...\n\n    def foo (self, x) { // Foo is an impure method\n        // ...\n    }    \n}\n\nAs specified above, impure methods are not virtual and therefore cannot be overloaded by inheritance.\nStatic methods\nThe name \"static method\" is an abuse of language to define functions defined within a class and which can be used without an object instance.\nA static method is accessible through the operator ::.\nUnlike methods, these functions do not take the `self' parameter as the first argument.\ntype MyType impl (i32) {\n\n    // ...\n\n    def foo (x : i32) { // This method is static\n        // ...\n    }\n\n}\n\n// The type can be directly used to call static methods\nMyType::foo (12); // Ok\n\n\nlet myvar = MyType::init ();\n\n// We can also use a variable of this type \nmyvar::foo (12); // Ok\n\n// The static method cannot be accessed using the dot operator\nmyvar.foo (12); // Error, type MyType does not have any method named foo\n\nAs with any function declaration, static methods can be pure or impure, and also template as we will see in the section dedicated to Templates.\nLimitations\nSince the constructor of an object is called in the same way as a static method, it is impossible to define a static method called init.\nOperator overloading\nOperator overloading can be defined within a class. Nevertheless, the operation of these overloads is fully similar to that defined outside a class. Therefore, the details of these overloads are defined in the following section Operator overloading.\n"},"types-personnalises/objects/inher.html":{"url":"types-personnalises/objects/inher.html","title":"Inheritance","keywords":"","body":"Inheritance\nInheritance is a system that allows you to apply different treatment to extended versions of a type. The inheritance in ymir is secure, requires no memory allocation and therefore guarantees that the program will not fail. It is therefore possible to use inheritance and polymorphism in a `safe' context. \nUnlike other object languages, inheritance in ymir only concerns methods, and does not allow to modify attributes. Indeed, the modification of the attributes would lead to a change in the size of the type of heir and would no longer allow polymorphism without an allocation.\nThere are however other forms of inheritance in Ymir, which also guarantee the security of the types but have other limitations and do not allow polymorphism as could be done in other object languages such as Java or C++. This system will be detailed in another section and is called the mixin.\nInheritance and construction\nInheritance is done through the keyword over. An heir type will have all the protected and public attributes of the parent class, as well as all the methods also protected or public. \nA constructor must be defined in the heir and the heir must call the constructor of the parent class before performing any operation.\n\ntype MyAncestor impl (i32) {\n\n    protected let _x : self.0;\n\n    self (x : i32) {\n        self._x = x;\n    }\n\n}\n\ntype MyInheriter over MyAncestor {\n\n    self () {\n        self.super::init (12); // super give access to ancestor type\n        println (self.0); // Ok, parent fields are protected\n        println (self._x); // Ok, _x is protected\n    }\n\n}\n\nFields aliases\nAs when declaring a class implementing a type, heir classes can access the data field using the tuple access syntax. These classes can also redefine new aliases to easily access the data fields.\ntype A impl (i32 | u64) {\n\n    let _x : self.0;\n\n    self () { self._x = 10; }\n\n}\n\n\ntype B over A {\n\n    let _z : self.1;\n\n    self () {\n        self.super::init ();\n        self._z = 10UL;\n    }\n\n}\n\nIt is impossible to replace an alias.

This allows you to modify the content of the function in order to apply different processing.\ntype A impl (void) {\n    // ...\n\n    def foo (self, x : i32) {\n        println (\"A : \", x);\n    }    \n}\n\ntype B over A {\n    // ... \n\n    over foo (self, x : i32) {\n        println (\"B : \", x);\n    }\n}\n\nlet b = B::init ();\nb.foo (2); // B : 2\n\nIt is not possible to implicitly override a method, the keyword over is mandatory.\n// ...\ntype B over A {\n    // ... \n\n    def foo (self, x : i32) { // Error, Cannot implicitly override method\n        println (\"B : \", x);\n    }\n}\n\nPure methods are the only methods that can be overloaded, since they are the only virtual methods. It is impossible to overload an impure method, because when creating a class, it is impossible to know how many functions will be generated by this impure function, and therefore to define the size of the virtual table of the type.\nPolymorphism\nThe heir types of a class are compatible with the ancestor type.
