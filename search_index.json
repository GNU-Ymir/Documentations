is a high level programming language, with static typing,\n  aiming to help developpers to gain time by proposing type safety,\n  and strong and safe semantic. The semantic of this language is\n  oriented on safety, concurrency and execution speed. Those\n  objectives are achieved thanks to its high expressivity and its\n  direct compilation to a efficient native machine language.\nThis documentation explores the main concept of Ymir, by proposing\na collection of examples that demonstrates the assets of this new\nlanguage. This travel, will presents some part of the standard library\nas well.\nInstallation\nThe reference compiler of Ymir is based on the compiler GCC,\nwhich offer strong static optimization, as well as a vast set of\nsupported target architectures.\nThere are two ways to install the gyc, natively which is not very recommended, the compiler being in beta version. Or by using a docker.\nNative installation\nThis compiler can be installed on linux debian system, by following those simple steps: \n\nFirst, you need to downloads the packages : \n\nlibmidgard-8-dev\nGYC\n\n\nAnd then, you need to install them using dpkg : \n\n\n$ sudo dpkg -i libgmidgard_8.2.0_amd64.deb\n$ sudo dpkg -i gyc-8_8.2.0_amd64.deb\n\nThe compiler is now installed and is named gyc-8\n$ gyc-8 --version\n\ngyc-8 (GCC) 8.2.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nUninstallation of the native version\nAs for any debian package, the uninstall is done as follows : \n$ dpkg -r gyc-8\n$ dpkg -r libgmidgard-8-dev\n\nCaution The uninstallation can remove your gcc installation.\nDocker installation\nTo start you have to install docker.\n$ sudo apt install docker.io\n\nThen retrieve the docker image from the repository :\n$ docker pull gnuymir/8.2.0\n\nThe compiler is now accessible via the container.\n$ docker run -t -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp gnuymir/8.2.0 --version \ngyc-8 (GCC) 8.2.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nTo make it easier to use, you can add an alias in the ~/.local/bin directory.\n$ echo \"docker run -t -v $(pwd):/tmp -w /tmp gnuymir/8.2.0 $*\" > ~/.local/bin/gyc-8\n$ chmod +x ~/.local/bin/gyc-8\n$ gyc-8 --version\n\ngyc-8 (GCC) 8.2.0\nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.

The type can be\nforced with the token :, but it must be compatible with the value. \nIf a variable is declared immutable, once a value is bound to it, it\ncannot change. In addition a variable must have an initial value, and\ncannot be declared without it.\nTo illustrate the variable declaration, you can try to run the following code. \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 2;    \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x);\n}\n\nYou should get the following error from the compiler : \nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(7,5)\n    | \n 7  |     x = 3;\n    |     ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nIn Ymir, the variable mutability and furthermore the type mutability\nguarantee by static verifications, that when you state that the value\nof a variable won't change it really won't change. Even if it can be a\nbit frustrating for the user sometimes.\nA variable is immutable by default, but sometime it can be useful to\nmake it mutable. To do so, you can use the keyword mut and\ndmut.  Mutability is applicable on types, and not only on\nvariables. The difference between these two keyword, is that\ndmut means the type of the variable is deeply mutable. The\nimmutability of a type is transitive, but this transitivity and what\nit implies will be explained in details in another chapter, since it\nis an advanced knowledge of the language Ymir.\nIf we take the same example as above, but with adding the keyword mut to the variable x.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let mut x = 2;    \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x); \n\n    x = 3; \n    println (\"X is equal to : \", x);\n}\n\nThis time, you will not get any error, and the following output should\nappear when you run the program.\nX is equal to : 2\nX is equal to : 3\nThe mutability of variable can be very useful, but sometimes a bit\nhard to tackle when dealing with complex types. Ymir introduce\naliases types, that are explained in details in the chapter\nAlias and References\nGlobal variables\nGlobal variable are variables that are declared outside a function,\nthey can be used for multiple reasons. Those kind of variable are\ndeclared using the keyword static. \nAs for every variables, those one can be either mutable or not, but\nare immutable by default.\nimport std::io\n\nstatic pi = 3.14159265359\n\ndef main () {\n    println (\"Pi value is : \", pi);\n}\n\nShadowing and scope\nAll the variable that are not global, have a lifetime that is defined\nby their scope. A scope is a segment of code, that have a begin and an\nend, in which statement are made. More informations about scope will\nbe given in the chapter about function bodies, in\nFunctions. \nTwo variable with the same name cannot be declared in colliding\nscopes, that is to say, if a variable is declared with a name of a\nvariable currently alive in the current scope, a shadowing error will\nbe raised.\nTo illustrate that, copy and run the following program. \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = 9;\n\n    let x = 12;\n}\n\nYou should get the following error, when compiling.\nError : declaration of x shadow another declaration\n --> main.yr:(6,9)\n    | \n 6  |     let x = 12;\n    |         ^\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(4,9)\n    | \n 4  |     let x = 9;\n    |         ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\n"},"primitives/types.html":{"url":"primitives/types.html","title":"Data types","keywords":"","body":"Primitives types\nIn Ymir language every value has a certain data type, which tells\nthe behavior of the program, and how to operate with the\nvalue. Ymir is statically typed language, which means that all the\ntype of all values must be known at compile time. Usually the compiler\nis able to infer the data types of the values, and there is no need to\nspecify them when declaring a variable. But sometimes, when dealing\nwith variable mutability, or class inheritance, for example, the\ninference could be wrong, and the behavior not adapted to what you\ncould want to do.\nTherefore, the type can be added when declaring a variable, as in the\nfollowing code.\nlet mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2];\nlet mut y = [1, 2];\n\nTo understand the difference, between the type of x, and the\ntype of y, I invite you to read the chapter\nAlias and References.\nEach integer type has type attributs, which are accessible using the\noperator ::, on a type.\nlet a = i32::init;  // i32 (0)\n\nEvery primitive types have common attributes that are listed in the table bellow : \n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value of the type\n\n\ntypeid\nThe name of the type stored in a value of type [c32]\n\n\n\nScalar types\nScalar types represents all the types containing a single\nvalue. Ymir has four primitive scalar types : integers, floating\npoint, characters, and boolean. They can have different size for\ndifferent purposes.\nInteger types\nAn integer is a number whithout decimal part. There are differents\ninteger types in Ymir, the signed one, and the unsigned\none. Signed and unsigned refers to the possibilty of a number to be\nnegative. The signed integer types begins with the letter i,\nwhen the unsigned ones begin with the letter u. The following\ntable lists all the different integer types, and sort them by memory\nsize.\n\n\n\nsize\nsigned\nunsigned\n\n\n\n\n8 bits\ni8\nu8\n\n\n16 bits\ni16\nu16\n\n\n32 bits\ni32\nu32\n\n\n64 bits\ni64\nu64\n\n\narch\nisize\nusize\n\n\n\nThe type usize and isize are types that are architecture\ndependent, and have the size of a pointer.\nEach signed integer types, can store values from -(2 n - 1) to\n2 n - 1 - 1, where n is the size of the integer in\nmemory. Unsigned types, in the other hand, can store number going from\n0 to 2 n - 1. For example, the type i8, can store values\nfrom -128 to 127, and the type u8 values from 0 to 255.\nYou can write literal for integer in two forms, decimal 9_234 and\nhexadecimal 0x897A. The token _, is simply ignored in a integer\nliteral.\nTo ensure that the literal has the type you want, you will need to add\nthe type as a prefix of the literal. For example, to get a i8 with\nthe value 7, you will have to write 7i8. By default, if no\nprefix is added at the end of the literal, its type is considered to\nbe a i32.\nAs said above, each type has attributs, the following table lists the\nattributs specific to integer :\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nmax\nThe maximal value\n\n\nmin\nThe minimal value\n\n\n\nA capacity overflow verification is made on the literals, and an error\nis returned by the compiler if the type of integer you have choose is\nnot large enough to contain the value. For example : \ndef main () {\n    let x : i8 = 934i8;\n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : overflow capacity for type i8 = 934\n --> main.yr:(2,18)\n    | \n 2  |     let x : i8 = 934i8;\n    |                  ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nHowever, if the value cannot be known at the compile time the overflow\nis not checked and can results in strange behaviour. For example, if\nyou try to add 1 to a variable of type i16 that contains the\nvalue 32767, the result will be -32768.\nFloating-point types\nThe floating point types, refers to the number having a decimal\npart. Ymir offers two floating point types, f32 and f64, that\nhave a respective size of 32 bits and 64 bits.\nYou can add the prefix f, at the end of a floating point literal\nto specify that you want a f32, instead of a f64 as it is\nby default.\ndef main () {\n    let x = 1.0; \n    let y : f32 = 1.0f;\n}\n\nThe following table list the attributes specific to floating point types.\n\n\n\nName\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ninit\nThe initial value - 0.0\n\n\nmax\nThe maximal finite value that this type can encode\n\n\nmin\nThe minimal finite value that this type can encode\n\n\nnan\nThe value Not a Number\n\n\ndig\nThe number of decimal digit of precision\n\n\ninfinity\nThe value positive infinity\n\n\nepsilon\nThe smallest increment to the value 1\n\n\nmant_dig\nNumber of bits in the  mantissa\n\n\nmax_10_exp\nmaximum int value such that 10^{max\\_10\\_exp} is representable\n\n\nmax_exp\nmaximum int value such that 2^{max\\_exp-1} is representable\n\n\nmin_10_exp\nminimum int value such that 10^{min\\_10\\_exp} is representable as a normalized value\n\n\nmin_exp\nminimum int value such that 2^{min\\_exp-1} is representable as a normalized value\n\n\n\nBoolean type\nA Boolean is a very simple type that can take two values, either true or false.\nFor example : \ndef main () {\n    let b = true;\n    let f : bool = false;\n}\n\nCharacter type\nThe c8 and c32 are the types used to encode characters.\nAs for integer literal, the prefix used to specify the type of a\ncharacter literal is c8, if nothing is specified the character\ntype will be c32. \nc32 character has a size of four bytes and can store any unicode\nvalue.  Character literals can have to forms, and are always surronded\nby the token '. The first form is the character itself r, and the\nsecond the unicode value in integer form \\u{12} or \\u{0xB}.\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺';    \n    let y = '\\u{0x263A}';\n}\n\nIf the characted literal is to long to be stored in the dezired type,\nan error will be returned by the compiler. For example :\ndef main () {\n    let x = '☺'c8; \n}\n\nThe error should be the following, and it means that you will need at\nleast 3 c8 to store the value, and therefore it does not fit in\na single c8 :\nError : malformed literal, number of c8 is 3\n --> main.yr:(2,10)\n    | \n 2  |     let x = '☺'c8; \n    |             ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nCompound types\nUnlike the scalar types, compound contains multiple values.  There are\nthree type of compound type: tuple, range and arrays.\nTuple\nA tuple is a collection of values of different types. Tuples have\nfixed arity, once it has been set at compile time, it cannot be\nchanged. Each element of a tuple has a type, and its order equally\ncannot be changed. Tuple are constructed inside parentheses, by a list\nof values separated by commas.\ndef main () {\n    let t : (i32, c32, f64) = (1, 'r', 3.14); \n}\n\nThe tuple t, is a single element, and can be passed as function\nparameter or as a return value of a function. It also can be\ndestructured, in order to retreive the values of its composing\nelements. There is three ways to do that, the first one is by using the\ndot operator ., and an integer compile time known value.\nimport std::io;\n\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let z : i32 = t._0;\n    let y : c32 = t. (0 + 1); \n    println (t.2);\n}\n\nThe other method is to used the tuple destructuring syntax, that will\ncreate new variables and therefore begins with the keyword let.\ndef main () {\n    let t = (1, 'r', 3.14);\n    let (x, y, z) = t;\n\n    let (f, e...) = t;\n    println (f, \" \", e.0);\n}\n\nIn the last example, we can that the tuple destructuring syntax allows\nto extract only some of the values of the tuple. The value of e\nin this example will be ('r', 3.14).\nThe last method to extract values from tuple is with the keyword\nexpand, this keyword is a compile time rewrite and the following\nexample demonstrate how you can use it.\nimport std::io\n\ndef add (a : i32, b : i32) -> i32 \n    a + b\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = (1, 2);\n    println (add (expand x)); \n\n    // Will be rewritten into :     \n    println (add (x.0, x.1));\n\n    // rewritter into : (1, x.0, x.1)\n    let j : (i32, i32, i32) = (1, expand x);    \n}\n\nRanges\nRange are types that contains two values defining an interval, and are\nnamed r!(T), where T is the type of the bounds of the interval. They\nare created by the token .. or .... A range is composed\nof four values, that are stored in the fields presented in the\nfollowing table.\n\n\n\nname\ntype\nvalue\n\n\n\n\nfst\nT\nthe first bound\n\n\nscd\nT\nthe second bound\n\n\nstep\nmut T\nthe step of the interval\n\n\ncontain\nbool\nIs the scd bound contained in the interval\n\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let range : r!(i32) = 1 .. 8;     \n    let c_range : r!(i32) = 1 ... 8;\n}\n\nThe function step_by take an interval as parameters and return a new\none, with a modified step.\ndef main () { \n    let range = (1 .. 8).step_by (2); \n}\n\nThe section Control flow shows a usage of those types. \nArrays\n An array is a collection of value of the same type, stored in\n contiguous memory.  Unlike Tuple, the size of an array is unknown at\n compile time, and in Ymir they are therefore similar to Slices.\n A slice is a two word object, the first word is the length of the\n slice, and the second a pointer to the data stored in the slice. A\n slice is an aliasable type, its mutability has is a bit more\n complicated than the mutability of scalar types, as it borrows memory\n that is not automatically copied when a affectation is made. This\n section will not talk about inner type mutability and aliasable\n types, so I recommand that you read the chapter\n Alias and References.\n The field len stores the length of the slice and can be\n retreived by the dot operator ..  The length of the slice is\n stored in a usize.\nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n   let x = [1, 2, 3];\n   println (\"The value of x : \", x); \n   println (\"The length of x : \", x.len);\n}\n\nEqually, the field ptr, give access to the pointer, of the slice\nand its types depend inner type of the slice, and is never mutable. For example : \nimport std::io\n\ndef main () {\n   let mut x : [mut i32] = [1, 2, 3];\n   *(x.ptr) = 8; \n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : left operand of type i32 is immutable\n --> main.yr:(6,4)\n    | \n 6  |    *(x.ptr) = 8;\n    |    ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nTo access array elements, the operator [] is used. It will take\neither a integer value, or a range value. If a range value is given, a\nsecond slice that borrow a section of the first one is created. For\nthe moment, the step of the interval does not affect the borrowing of\nthe array.\nimport std::io\ndef main () {\n    let x = [1, 2, 3];\n    let y = x [0..2];\n    let z = x [0];\n\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z); \n}\n\nThe operator ~ is used to make a concatenation of two arrays of the same type : \nimport std::io\n\ndef foo () -> [i32] {\n    [8, 7, 6]\n}\n\ndef main ()  {\n    println ([1, 2, 3] ~ foo ());\n}\n\n"},"primitives/functions.html":{"url":"primitives/functions.html","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Functions\nFunction is a largely accepted concept to divide a program in small\nparts.

If a parameter has a\nvalue, it is the value that is used by default, and it is therefore\noptionnal to specify value when calling the function for that\nparticular parameter. If you still want to specify a value, you will\nhave to use a named expression that is formed using the token\n->.\nimport std::io\n\ndef foo (x : i32 = 8) {\n    println (\"The value of x is : \", x);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo ();\n    foo (x-> 7);\n}\n\nThe named expression can equally be used for parameters that does not\nhave default value. A named expression, will allow you to specify the\nparameter in the order you want. The algorithm, to determine which\nparameter an argument is refering to, illustrated by the example : \ndef foo (x : i32, y : i32 = 9, z : i32) {\n    println (x, \" \", y, \" \", z);\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    foo (8, y-> 1, x-> 2);\n}\n\nThe algorithm is the following : \nLet args be the list of arguments ([y-> 1, x-> 2, 8])\nLet params be the list of parameters (x, y=9, z)\nLet final_args = [], be the list of final arguments\nfor each p in params :\n    for a in args :\n        if p.name == a.name : \n            final_args = final_args ~ [a]\n            remove p in params\n            remove a in args\n            found = true\n            break\n    if not found : \n        final_args = final_args ~ [args [0]]\n        remove p in params\n        remove args [0] in args\n\nIn this example, the result of each step will be : \n1, x : [x-> 2]\n2, y : [x-> 2, y-> 1]\n3, z : [x-> 2, y-> 1, 8]\nFunction body\nThe body of a function is an expression.

A block is surronded by the token {},\nand the last expression in a block is its value. \ndef main () {\n    let x = {\n        let y = 9;\n        y + 1\n    }\n}\n\nThe token ;, is a way of specifying that an expression ends in a\nblock, and that the value of the block is the expression that\nfollows. If no expression follows the value of the block is evaluated\nto nothing and its type is void. For example, if we write the\nfollowing code :\ndef foo () -> i32 \n    9\n\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = {\n        foo ();\n    }\n}\n\nYou should get the following error from the compiler : \nError : cannot declare var of type void\n --> main.yr:(6,9)\n    | \n 6  |     let x = {\n    |         ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nFunction return type\nSometimes a function can return a value, the type of the value must be\ndefined at the end of the function definition before the value, by\nusing the token ->. The type of the value of the function must\nbe the same as the type defined in the prototype.\ndef foo (x : i32)-> i32 \n    x + 1\n\ndef bar (x : i32, y : i32) -> i32 {\n    let z = x + y;\n    println (\"The value of z : \", z);\n    foo (z)\n}\n\nThe keyword return is used to end a function prematurely.\ndef isDivisable (x : i32, z : i32) -> bool {\n    if (z == 0) return false;\n\n    (x % z) == 0\n}\n\nIf the value of the body of the function is not equivalent to the type\nof the function, and if there is a possibility that the function never\nencounter a return statement an error is returned by the compiler. For\nexample with the following code :\nimport std::io\n\ndef add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    x + 1;\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = add_one (5);\n    println (\"The value of x : \", x);\n}\n\nYou should get the following error : \nError : incompatible types i32 and void\n --> main.yr:(3,29)\n    | \n 3  | def add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    |                             ^\nNote : \n --> main.yr:(5,1)\n    | \n 5  | }\n    | ^\n\nymir1: fatal error: \ncompilation terminated.\nBut if you change the last expression by a return statement, for example : \nimport std::io\n\ndef add_one (x : i32)-> i32 {\n    if (x == 12) {\n        return x + 1\n    } else {\n        return x + 2\n    }\n}\n\ndef main () {\n    let x = add_one (5);\n    println (\"The value of x : \", x);\n}\n\nThe compiler won't return any error.\n"},"primitives/control.html":{"url":"primitives/control.html","title":"Control flows","keywords":"","body":"Control flows\nWhen writing a program, the ability to decide to execute part of the\ncode conditionally, or to repeat part of the code, is a basic schema\nthat can be really useful.\nIn Ymir unlike many C-like language, there is no such things as\na statement, everything is an expression and can be evaluated.

The standard type, can be copied without explicitly\ninforming the compiler. These types, are all primitive types, except\nthe slices. On the other hand, aliasable types, are types that have\nborrowed data, which will not be copied, if not explicitly written\ninto the code, to avoid performance loss.\nTo understand how data is represented in a program, you need to know\nthe difference between heap and stack.
