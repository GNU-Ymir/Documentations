# Primitive types

Every value have a type, which tell how the value will be used and computed. In this section we will discuss about the types which are built into the language. 

## Scalar types 
	
### Integer types

An integer is a number without fractional part. There are different integer types in **Ymir**, signed or unsigned. Signed and unsigned refers to the possibility of a number to be negative. The following table lists all the integer types in **Ymir**.

| Size | Signed | Unsigned |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8-bits | i8 | u8 |
| 16-bits | i16 | u16 |
| 32-bits | i32 | u32 |
| 64-bits | i64 | u64 |

### Floating-point types

Floating-Point numbers are numbers with a decimal points. **Ymir** has two types for floating-point numbers, `f32` and `f64`. The default type is `f64`. 

### Boolean types

A boolean type has two possible value, `true` or `false`. The type is specified by the name `bool`.

### Character types
