# Objects

**Ymir** is a object oriented language. But unlike many oriented
language, it is statically typed, and safe. Unlike `java` or `D`, the
class does not inherit the global class `Object`, and an object
instance can't be null. Every variable that contains object are
assured to contain a value, and that access to that value won't
produce any crash of the program.
