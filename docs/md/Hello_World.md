The following source code is the traditional _Hello World_ program.

```Rust 
def main () {
	println ("Hello World !!");
}
```
`println` is a function that prints text to the console.

This program need to be compiled by *Ymir* compiler to create binary.
```
ymir hello.yr
```

This will produce a `a.out` that can be executed
```
./a.out
Hello World !!
```
